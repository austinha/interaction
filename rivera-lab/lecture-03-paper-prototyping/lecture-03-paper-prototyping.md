# Goals for Today
- Paper Prototyping

- User Testing

- Questions about A0, A1, Layouts?

## How do these differ?

## What is Paper Prototyping?
- Fast and cheap way to create and test user interfaces

--

- It's equivalent to storyboarding in the film industry

--

- Focuses on function, less on form

--

- All you need: pen, paper (and possibly scissors/tape)

## User Testing

---
## Task Scenarios for User Testing (1/2)
- What should users accomplish using your interface?

--

- Provide a scenario for when the task would be done

--

  - Consider a calendar mobile application-

--

  - "A long time friend has just returned from an extended trip. She'd like to catch up and invites you to dinner this Monday at 6pm. As a reminder, you want to add this event to your calendar."
---
## Task Scenarios for User Testing (2/2)
-  Make it __realistic__

--

- Make it __actionable__
--

- Don't just directly tell the user to do something

--

- Never tell them the steps

## Exercise
- Brainstorming - a To Do List app (7 mins)

--

- Paper Prototype the app in groups of 3 (20 mins)

--

- Come up with Task Scenarios (5 min)

--

- User Test with 2 students from another group (15 min)

--

- Refine your Prototype (10 min)

--

- User Test with 1 student (10 min)

--

- Discussion (10 min)

---

## Discussion

--

- What can and can't you learn from it?

--

- Why is this hard for mobile applications?
  
--

  - Context-aware Applications?

--

- What other low-fi techniques can we use?
