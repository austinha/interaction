# Accessibility Exercise

**Objective**: Identify and repair app accessibility issues.

**Learning Goals**:
- Activity Lifecycle
- Event callbacks
- Familiarize with different layout types
- Basic constraints

**Assigned Date**: ???, 2019

**Due Date**: ???, 2019

# Part 1

Tasks:
- Learn different categories of app accessibility issues
- Identify accessibility issues in our example app

Please read Table 2 on page 8 of [Epidemiology as a Framework for Large-Scale Mobile Application Accessibility Assessment](https://xiaoyizhang.me/assets/Paper/ASSETS_2017_Epidemiology.pdf)

Our example app may not have ALL issues in the table. Try to identify as many issues as you can.

Should we ask them to write a report with the description of each issue? It increases the workload of TA...

Or we only grade based on how many issues are repaired? (What if they can identify but cannot repair some issues?)

I am not sure if we should provide them Google Accessibility Scanner? (Although it may not cover all issues...)

We should tell them how to use Talkback, and provide basic instructions like:
