## Activity.red[*]

- Application component providing a screen for users to interact

--

- Typically fills whole the screen (though it doesn't have to)

## Activity and Events
- Event-based interaction paradigm

--

- Your code should respond to event changes, interactions, and processes

--

- Get familiar with its state changes and __Lifecycle__
---
## Activity States
- __Active__: in foreground of screen, and receives input

--

- __Paused__: activity lost focus (is no longer displayed on screen)

--

- __Stopped__:
  - Another activity has focus

  - Original activity remains in memory -- perfect place to save data & state

  - Often can be *killed* by Android OS if not resumed relatively quickly

--

- __Inactive__: after an activity has been killed; or before it is launched

---

## Switching States - Activity Lifecycle

---
## Responding to State Changes with Callbacks (1/3)
- `onCreate`
--

  - called when the activity is first created
  - we've seen this in our `HelloAndroidWorld` App:

--


```java
@Override
protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
  // We want to do any view initialization work here
  super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
  // Load the XML representation of our layout into the view
  setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);
  // Remember findViewById let's us find the xml views we declared in our
  // program (this is a link between the xml world and java)
  mMainTextView = (TextView) findViewById(R.id.text_main_title);
  mSumTextView = (TextView) findViewById(R.id.text_sum);
}
```

--

- `onStart`
  - Called when activity is about to be visible to the user
  - Always gets called after `onCreate` or `onRestart`

---
## Responding to State Changes with Callbacks (2/3)

- `onResume`
  - Called when the activity will start interacting with a use
--

  - Always gets called after `onStart`  

--


- `onPause`
  - Called when the system is about to start resuming another previous activity
--

  - __Commit changes__ to persistent data, __stop animations & intense operations__, __kill network__ requests  
--

  - .red[Fast implementation required!] - the next activity will not resume until this finishes in your activity

--


- `onStop`: Called when the activity is no longer visible to the user

---
## Responding to State Changes with Callbacks (3/3)

- `onRestart`
--

  - Called when the activity was previously stopped but is coming back to the user
  - Followed by a call to `onStart`

--


- `onDestroy`: the final notice before your activity is .red[__destroyed__]
