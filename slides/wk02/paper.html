# Marc Rettig’s Problems with Hi-Fi Prototypes

Can you list some?
???
Hi-Fi prototypes take too long to build and change

Reviewers and testers tend to comment on detailed, low-level issues rather than big picture

Developers resist change

A prototype in software can set expectations that are hard to change

A single bug in a hi-fi prototype can bring a test to a complete halt

The visual look of your prototype is its most salient dimension. If not properly selected, it can sidetrack prototype reviews. Go hi-fi too soon and users will focus on aesthetics like color and font choice, which is not appropriate in early stages.

'Oh, it's made out of cardboard! (laughs)'- Nintendo president Satoru
Iwata marvels atthe simplicity of an early prototype of the Wii U's
tablet controller (pictured above).Nintendo is banking on its
Miiverse -- a sort of mini-Facebook with a layer of console game --
	 -- makeup -- to draw players to its new Wii U console. It was
a new concept, running on a new type of game hardware with the
tablet-like GamePad.

Nintendo contracted fellow Kyoto social media
company Hatena Co. Ltd. to do a lot of the Miiverse design work. The
Wii U's tablet-infused GamePad hadn't been finalized yet, but Hatena
UI designer Kazuyuki Motoyama felt that he needed to know how the
Miiverse would feel in his hands, so the company developed the basic
feel of it with this simple cardboard prototype.

'We wouldn't know how it felt unless we could actually hold it, but
since we didn't have one, the only thing to do was make one,' Motoyama
explains. 'In the middle of the night, I cut pieces of cardboard and
glued them together.'

Ithink there's a game development lesson here. You can prototype just
about anything with the tools available to you, on just about any
budget. Whether it's paper or an HTML website or even a free copy of
UDK or Unity, you shouldn't let available technology hold you back
from trying new ideas.

If paper prototyping is good enough for a feature embedded in millions of Nintendo-made consoles, it's probably good enough for you too.

it appear to be fully functional and respond to user input

.right-column[
We have found subjects reluctant to be critical of designs when they are asked to assign a rating to the design. In our usability tests, we see the same phenomenon even when we encourage subjects to be critical. 
]
--
.right-column[
We speculate that the test subjects feel that giving a low rating to a
product gives the impression that they are “negative” people, that the
ratings reflect negatively on their ability to use computer-based
technology, that some of the blame for a product’s poor performance
falls on them, or that they don’t want to hurt the feelings of the
person conducting the test.

# Exercise

layout: false
## Exercise
- Brainstorming - a To Do List app (7 mins)

--

- Paper Prototype the app in groups of 3 (20 mins)

--

- Come up with Task Scenarios (5 min)

--

- User Test with 2 students from another group (15 min)

--

- Discussion (10 min)

--

Things we would add if we had time!
- Refine your Prototype (10 min)

--

- User Test with 1 student (10 min)

---

## Discussion

--

- What can and can't you learn from it?

--

- Why is this hard for mobile applications?
  
--

  - Context-aware Applications?

--

- What other low-fi techniques can we use?
