People's visual abilities have a big impact on everything from how we
model color to what makes for good design

People have a variety of visual capabilities, which you should know
- 4.5% of the world population (mostly men) is color blind<sup>1</sup>
- 17% of the world population live with some vision impairment<sup>2</sup>

Good design is generally more accessible design

So why is the color choice poor? 
- No mapping of color (note on right how blues are used for water, and greens for land)
- Color is better if you adjust by saturation (purity) or value (brightness) rather than hue (rough color, ie red, green, blue, orange) for mapping. People can more easily see and compare differences in saturation and value over hue. Also, changes in hue don’t naturally map to a scale, whereas saturation and value do.

Test in greyscale

Focus on value over hue or saturation

This will help ensure visibility

Can use a b/w photocopier to help if you already have a GUI

Keep luminance / intensity / value the same from grayscale when moving to color

---
.title[Designing Tip #4: Minimize saturated Colors]

.medium.right-column70[
Different wavelengths of light focus at different distances behind
eye’s lens

If your GUI has lots of reds and blues, will force lots of
refocusing and cause fatigue

Design Implication
Pure (saturated) colors require more focusing than less pure
(desaturated, pastel)

Avoid saturated colors in UIs unless really need something to stand
out (stop sign)

Trouble discriminating colors

About 9% of males, 0.5% of females

Two main types
- Different photopigment response is common
 - Reduces capability to discern small color diffs
- Red-green deficiency is best known
 - Lack of either green or red photopigment can’t discriminate colors dependent on R & G
 - More rare are blue-yellow and total color blindness

Some women have a fourth type of cone
- Estimates are 12% women
- Some can see more colors than ordinary humans

Human Physiology drives design

Good design is accessible design 

- There is tons to know about good use of color and other visual
design elements. For not, the simplest thing to do is to look for existing color palettes, and just those. That should account for the vast majority of your needs for colors. There is also red-green color blindness too. Simplest thing to do is to turn your screens into greyscale, and see if you can see differences.
