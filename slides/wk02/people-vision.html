# Visual Properties of People
People's visual abilities have a big impact on everything from how we
model color to what makes for good design

People have a variety of visual capabilities, which you should know
- 4.5% of the world population (mostly men) is color blind<sup>1</sup>
- 17% of the world population live with some vision impairment<sup>2</sup>

Good design is generally more accessible design

So why is the color choice poor? 
- No mapping of color (note on right how blues are used for water, and greens for land)
- Color is better if you adjust by saturation (purity) or value (brightness) rather than hue (rough color, ie red, green, blue, orange) for mapping. People can more easily see and compare differences in saturation and value over hue. Also, changes in hue don’t naturally map to a scale, whereas saturation and value do.

Photopigments not distributed evenly

- Mainly reds (64%) & few blues (2-4%)
- Less sensitive to short wavelengths (blue)

Few blue cones in fovea

- Harder to see small blue objects you fixate on
- Blue text also slightly harder to read

So blue hyperlinks as default is worst choice

- Note: strong contrast >> avoiding blue

# Design Tip #3: Make sure that contrast is high enough

## Accessibility Issue!
WCAG requires *at least 4.5:1* contrast, so you cannot round a
contrast ratio up to 4.5:1. For example, #777777 <br>(![:img grey with
black text,3%](img/777777.png)![:img grey with
white text,3%](img/777777w.png)) is a commonly-used
shade of gray with a 4.48:1 contrast ratio. It does not meet the WCAG
contrast threshold.<sup>1</sup>

Test in greyscale

Focus on value over hue or saturation

This will help ensure visibility

Can use a b/w photocopier to help if you already have a GUI

Keep luminance / intensity / value the same from grayscale when moving to color

# Designing Tip #4: Minimize saturated Colors

.medium.right-column70[
Different wavelengths of light focus at different distances behind
eye’s lens

If your GUI has lots of reds and blues, will force lots of
refocusing and cause fatigue

Design Implication
Pure (saturated) colors require more focusing than less pure
(desaturated, pastel)

Avoid saturated colors in UIs unless really need something to stand
out (stop sign)

# Color Blindness: Ishihara Test

If you can’t see numbers, don’t worry
- Projectors, LCD screens, CRT, and print all have different dynamic ranges, hard to get them to match

???

Trouble discriminating colors

About 9% of males, 0.5% of females

Two main types
- Different photopigment response is common
 - Reduces capability to discern small color diffs
- Red-green deficiency is best known
 - Lack of either green or red photopigment can’t discriminate colors dependent on R & G
 - More rare are blue-yellow and total color blindness

Some women have a fourth type of cone
- Estimates are 12% women
- Some can see more colors than ordinary humans

# Design Tip #5: Use Redundant Cues
Don't rely solely on Hue: Use mixtures of colors (red / green issues)

Also have contrast in intensity 

Consider having other redundant cues too
 - What redundant cues used for traffic signs?

Traffic signs have multiple cues: color, word, shape

# Summary

Human Physiology drives design
- Number of colors
- Pixel size (retina displays)

Good design is accessible design 

- There is tons to know about good use of color and other visual
design elements. For not, the simplest thing to do is to look for existing color palettes, and just those. That should account for the vast majority of your needs for colors. There is also red-green color blindness too. Simplest thing to do is to turn your screens into greyscale, and see if you can see differences.
