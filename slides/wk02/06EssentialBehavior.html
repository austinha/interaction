.left-column[##Interaction Technique]
.right-column[
A method for carrying out a specific interactive task

Example: enter a number in a range

could use...
]
???
have the class try to think of examples
--
.right-column[
- (simulated) slider
- (simulated) knob
- type in a number (text edit box)

Each is a different interaction technique
]
---
.left-column[##Example: Specify the end points for a line]
.right-column[
Could just specify two endpoints – click, click
- not good: no affordance, no feedback (/ feedforward)

Better feedback is to use “rubber banding”
- stretch out the line as you drag
- at all times, shows where you would end up if you “let go”
]
---
.left-column[##Implementing rubber banding]

.right-column[```
Accept the press for endpoint P1; P2 = P1;
Draw line P1-P2;
Repeat
  Erase line P1-P2;
  P2 = current_position(); Draw line P1-P2;
Until release event;
Act on line input;
```
]
---
.left-column[##Implementing rubber banding]

Need to get around this loop absolute min of 5 times / sec

– 10 times better

– more would be better

???
aside -- why 5-10 times per second?

---
.left-column[##What is wrong with this code?]

.right-column[```
Accept the press for endpoint P1; P2 = P1;
Draw line P1-P2;
Repeat
  Erase line P1-P2;
  P2 = current_position(); Draw line P1-P2;
Until release event;
Act on line input;
```
]
???
Not event based
Not in the basic event/redraw loop
Potentially locks up the system
---
.left-column[## Event driven code]
.right-column[
Needs to respond to events as they arrive

Needs to maintain state between events 

]

---
.left-column[##Simple solution: Deterministic Finite State Machines]
.right-column[
- Arrow for start state

- double circle for 'final state' (really means 'reset to start')
]
???
XXX TODO need to decide if/where to use this slide and either update
graphs in slides to follow this format or delete it 
---
.left-column[##FSM Notation

Transitions represent actions (callbacks)
]
.right-column[
<div class="mermaid">
  graph LR
    A((A)) -- "Mouse_Dn/Draw_Line()" --> B((B))
</div>
  Means: When you are in state A, and a Mouse Down event arrives, do
  the action ```Draw_line()``` and go to state B. 
]
---
.left-column[#FSM for rubber banding?]
.right-column[
- Determine the states

- Determine the triggers (events)

- Determine the actions

```
Accept the press for endpoint P1; P2 = P1;
Draw line P1-P2;
Repeat
  Erase line P1-P2;
  P2 = current_position(); Draw line P1-P2;
Until release event;
Act on line input;
```
]

???
A: DRAW LINE
B: LOOP CONTENTS
C: ACTION
---
Pair up and discuss:

How could we provide a better affordance?

Does it matter if we are using a mouse or a touch screen?

???
XXX todo: decide where these slides go
