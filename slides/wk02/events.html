# Handling Input
Generally, input is harder than output

- More diversity, less uniformity

- More affected by human properties

---
# Is this an input device?

![:img Picture of swipe keyboard showing text entry of satisfying, 50%](img/swipe.png)

--
No … it’s an interaction technique. Over 50 WPM!
???
Who/what/where/etc
Dimensionality – how many dimensions can a device sense?
Range – is a device bounded or unbounded?
Mapping – is a device absolute or relative?

---
# Interaction techniques / Widgets make input devices effective

For example, consider text entry: 
- 60-80 (keyboards; twiddler)
- ~20 (soft keyboards)
- ~50? Swype – but is it an input device?

---
# Modern hardware and software starting to muddy the waters around this

???
Add OLEDs to keys -> reconfigurable label displays

---
# Can never ignore hardware completely

Consider Location

What is different about a joystick, a touch screen, and a mouse?

???
Mouse was originally just a 1:1 mapping in 2 dimensions == absolute
location; bounded

Joystick is relative (maps movement into rate of change in location); unbounded

Touch screen is absolute; bounded

What about today's mouse? Lifting?

# The Glue between Widgets and Input Devices

Discussion of Events: Logical Device Approach

???

- Helps us deal with a diversity of devices

- Make sure everyone understands types of events

- Make sure everyone has a basic concept of how one registers listeners

Logical Device Approach:

- Valuator -> returns a scalar value

- Button -> returns integer value

- Locator -> returns position on a logical view surface

- Keyboard -> returns character string

- Stroke -> obtain sequence of points

- Pick -> select an object

- Value changes only when activated
- e.g. button

Sampled devices
- Time of input determined by program
- Value is continuously changing

Each kind of event has its own class but they all implement the event interface
- A little hard to find all the parts defined in one place
- Harder to deal with uniformly
- But easily extensible for new event types

Each kind of event has its own class

## Input Handling Process
]
.right-column[
Events represent input
- Go into a queue
- Are passed to apps
 - Front event comes off
 - recursive pick() to identify objects of interest (or just focus())
 - ‘capture()’ (most things don’t) top to bottom deliver to target object (bottom)
 - ‘bubble()’ (bottom to top)

Apps have to listen for events
]
---

# Responding to Users

- When a user interacts with our apps, Android creates __events__

--

- As app developers, we react "listening" for events and responding appropriately

--

- Let's look at some of the ways users can give input and we can respond

# Discussion of Listeners

???

- Implementation strategy

- Basic goal: notify the view of a change


---
# Basics of Event Listeners (1/3)

- Interface on the `View` class that acts as a _callback_ method

--

- Must be attached to a particular `View`

--

- Android framework triggers the method once the `View` has interacted with by the user

--

- A `View` can have listen for different types of interactions
- But: the `View` must implement and registering the appropriate listeners

---

# Basics of Event Listeners (2/2)

- The set of Android's provided interfaces include:
  ```java
    // User tapped a view
    public static interface View.OnClickListener { ... }

    // User long pressed on a View
    public static interface View.OnLongClickListener { ... }

    // State of view has changed
    // (e.g. user clicked outside a EditText input box)
    public static interface View.OnFocusChangeListener { ... }
  ```
  More listed in the API Documentation (https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/ui-events.html)
---

# Declaring an Event Listener
- Two ways to use declare an event listener:

  - Create an Anonymous Class

  - Implement an Interface

---
## Create an Anonymous Class
```java
  public class ExampleActivity extends AppCompatActivity {

    private Button mButton;
    private int mButtonClicks = 0;

    // As a member variable in an Activity
    private View.OnClickListener mClickListener = new View.OnClickListener() {
      public void OnClick(View v) {
        if (mButton != v) {
          // Do nothing if its not the right view
          return;
        }
        // Increment the click count
        mButtonClicks += 1;
      }
    };

    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedState) {
      Button mButton = (Button) findViewById(R.id.button_test);
      if (mButton != null) {
        // 'this' refers to the activity itself here
        // When the button clicked, Android will trigger
        // the Activity's OnClick method
        mButton.setOnClickListener(mClickListener);
      }
    }
  }
```
---
## Implement the Interface
  ```java
    // Start by implementing the interface
    public class ExampleActivity extends AppCompatActivity
      implements View.OnClickListener { // Necessary to implement

      private Button mButton;
      private int mButtonClicks = 0;

      protected void onCreate(Bundle savedState) {
        Button mButton = (Button) findViewById(R.id.button_test);
        if (mButton != null) {
          // 'this' refers to the activity itself here
          // When the button clicked, Android will trigger
          // the Activity's OnClick method
          mButton.setOnClickListener(this);
        }
      }

      // Here's where you do the implementation of your listener
      public void OnClick(View v) {
        if (mButton != v) {
          // Do nothing if its not the right view
          return;
        }
        // Increment the click count
        mButtonClicks += 1;
      }

    }
  ```
---

# Registering a Listener (1/2)

- Once a listener is created
  ```java
    View.OnClickListener buttonListener = new View.OnClickListener({
      public void OnClick(View v) {
        if (mButton != v) {
          // Do nothing if its not the right view
          return;
        }
        // Increment the click count
        mButtonClicks += 1;
      }
    });
  ```

--

- Set it on the view:
  ```java
    Button mButton = (Button) findViewById(R.id.button_test);
    if (mButton != null) {
      mButton.setOnClickListener(buttonListener);
    }
  ```
---
# Registering a Listener (2/2)

- `View` has a series of `set*Listeners(...)`, for example:
  ```java
  View v = new View();
  v.setOnClickListener(...);
  v.setLongClickListener(...);
  ```
---

# Exercise

- Pair up! - Base Code (http://shoutkey.com/come)

- Using listeners, when the pup is clicked, increment a petting count

- When long clicked, show a `Toast` saying "that tickles!" (but don't increment the count !)

# How Android Triggers Listeners

- Android traverses the view hierarchy (starting at root)

--

- "Picks" `Views` that respond to an input event

--

- Loops through the list of `View` objects, checks if they will "capture" the event

--

- If none capture the event, the event "bubbles" back up the `View` object list

---
# Input Example - Picking
```
      V0
    /   \
   V1*   V4*
  / \    / \
V2  V3* V5 V6*

// *: denotes the element responds to the event
```
--

- What `View` objects does Android "pick"?

--

- Picked Views = { `V1`, `V3`, `V4`, `V6`}

--

- Order matters!
---
# Input Example - Capture

- Picked Views = { `V1`, `V3`, `V4`, `V6`}

- What happens next?
--

- Android starts at the front of the picked `View` object list

--

- In order, Android asks: will you consume this event?
--

  - If `true`: the event is consumed and the event propagation __stops__

  - If `false`: Move to the next element in the `View` list

--

- What happens when we reach the last `View` in the list and no one has consumed the event?

---
# Input Example - Bubbling

- Picked Views = { `V1`, `V3`, `V4`, `V6`}

--

- Android backtracks through the list, asking if they want to consume the event

--

- Who gets asked first ?

---
# Input Example - Recap
.three-quarters-width[
|State           |Ordering|
|:---------------|:-------|
|*Picking*       | V1| V3 | V4 | V6|
|*Capture Order* | 1 | 2  | 3  | 4 |
|*Bubbling Order*| 4 | 3  | 2  | 1 |
]

---
# Marking an event as handled
- Many listeners return a `boolean` value that indicate the event has been handled
  ```java
    /**
     * onLongClick - triggered when a view is long clicked
     * @param v - the view long pressed
     * @return - true if the callback consumed the long click, false otherwise.
     **/
    boolean onLongClick (View v) { ... };
  ```
--

- Returning `false` causes the event to bubble up to the next possible view that can handle it



[API Documentation for Long Click](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.OnLongClickListener.html)
---

## Many Views, Same Listener (1/3)

- Event callbacks are passed the `View` as a parameter

--

- We can reuse a listener for views that handle the same action
  (e.g. 3 buttons increment the same click count)

---

## Many Views, Same Listener (2/3)

- And we can handle different actions by checking the `View` or its `id`:
  ```java
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedState) {
      Button mButtonOne = (Button) findViewById(R.id.button_one);
      if (mButtonOne != null) {
        mButtonOne.setOnClickListener(mButtonClickListener);
      }

      Button mButtonTwo = (Button) findViewById(R.id.button_two);
      if (mButtonTwo != null) {
        mButton.setOnClickListener(mButtonClickListener);
      }
    }
  ```
---
## Many Views, Same Listener (3/3)

```java
  View.OnClickListener mButtonClickListener = new View.OnClickListener({
    public void OnClick(View v) {
      if (v == null) {
        return;
      }

      int viewId = v.getId();

      switch (viewId) {
        case R.id.button_one:
          // First Button
          Log.d("Button Press", "First Button");
          break;
        case R.id.button_two:
          // Second Button
          Log.d("Button Press", "Second Button");
          break;
        default:
          // Someone else is using the listener!
          Log.d("Button Press", "Invalid Button!");

      }
    }
  });
```

# More on Listeners

- Different views can have different handlers

--

    - `ListView`: `onItemClick`
    - Context menus from long clicks: `onCreateContextMenu`
    - Keystrokes: `onKey`
    - And others...

--

- Check documentation for specifics

---
# Types of Input

- Not just touches, clicks, key presses

--

- *Sensors* - GPS, IMU/Accelerometer, humidity, temperature, etc

--
  - `Managers` (e.g. `LocationManager`) let us create and register a listener

  - Listeners can receive updates at different intervals, etc.

  - Some Sensor-specific settings  
    https://source.android.com/devices/sensors/sensor-types.html

---
# Other Kinds of Input

- Microphone

- Camera

- Multi-touch

- Connected Devices?
