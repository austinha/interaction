# Relating the Human and the Machine

- Gulf of Execution and Gulf of Evaluation

Gulf of execution is the user 'error' region (user requests
  function the __system DOESNT HAVE__), gulf of
  evaluation is when the user __doesn't realize the system HAS a
functionality__.

Sketch out key concepts 
- Input -- we need to know when people are doing things. This needs to be event driven.
- Output -- we need to show people feedback. This cannot ‘take over’ i.e. it needs to be multi threaded
- Back end -- we need to be able to talk to the application. 
- State machine -- we need to keep track of state. 
- What don’t we need? We don’t need to know about the rest of the UI, probably, etc etc
- Model View Controller -- this works within components (draw diagram), but also represents the overall structure (ideally) of a whole user interface
- NOTE: Be careful to write any new vocabulary words on the board and define as they come up.

- Discuss
???
discuss with your neighbor based on the reading what does the
toolkit need to know to draw this 
- what to draw; where to draw it
- what are good abstractions for this?
- Hierarchy normally reflects spatial containment relationships

--

- Deconstruct

 - Let's list all the components... and arrange them in a tree
 
???

- deconstruct this interface into an interactor hierarchy

# How is the tree used for drawing?
- Programmer:
 - Build and interface == build an interactor hierarchy
 - Change an interface == change the interactor hierarchy (or its --
 - parameters)
--

- Toolkit:
 - Draw an interface == walk the tree and draw things
 - Update an interface == walk the tree, clip, translate, redraw()
 - Deliver input == walk the tree and deliver events (TBD)
--

- Components:
 - Receive redraw()
 - Show feedback (how?)
 - Respond to input 
 - Send notifications of model changes

???
HTML is like this too

# Drawing on the Screen
- What is a Graphics object and how do you draw on it?
- Importance of pixel vs stroke model
- Making it pretty: Buffering & Anti Aliasing
???
- Talk about canvas, graphics object, object for each thing, etc Efficiencies?
- Mention redraw
- Discuss inconsistencies across toolkits -- whorfian effects again
- Discuss raster graphics and where coordinates are (00 at top left)

# Drawing in Android

- `Canvas` is an object level abstraction for performing drawing operations

--

- All drawing should be done in `protected void onDraw(Canvas canvas) {...}`
---
# How does Canvas work?

- Drawing is done by calling methods for different kinds of objects
--

- For example: `drawRect`, `drawOval`, `drawLine`, `drawPath` ...

  [Full List in the API Documentation](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/Canvas.html)

---
# How does Canvas work?

- Drawing is done by calling methods for different kinds of objects

- Keeps track of other related operations

--
  - Links drawing operations to a `Bitmap` (Frame Buffer of pixels)

--

  - Handles __clipping__ of drawing boundaries

???
Clipping is super efficient if limited to a rectangle
Implications for GUI design
--

  - Performs __transformations__ on drawn visual elements

---
# Work through clipping example (bell)

Which of the following must a parent component do before passing a
drawable region to the child? [raise your hands]

- [a] Translate (child.x, child.y)
- [b] Clip(parent.x, parent.y, parent.w, parent.h)
- [c] Translate (-child.x, -child.y)
- [d] Clip(0,0,child.w,child.h)

---
# Coordinate Transformations in Android

```java
  Canvas c = new Canvas();

  // Set the drawing boundary
  c.setClippingRect(100, 50, 200, 100);

  // Draw the shape
  c.drawRect(0, 0, 50, 50);

  // Move origin to where shape's top-left corner is
  c.translate(100, 50);

  // Draw another Rect inside the Rect just drawn
  c.drawRect(10,10,10,10);

  // Return state back to before the translation & clipping
  c.restore();
```

---
# Coordinate Transformations

Linear (“affine”) transformation

– Translate, Scale, Rotate, Shear (and any combination thereof)

--

- Translate: Move origin (and everything else) in x and y

???
used extensively in GUIS because child objects just draw themselves
at *their* origin, so a component doesn't have to calculate how to draw
itself based on its position

--

- Scale: change size (negative == flip)
![:img a large and small moon, 15%](img/scale.png)

--

- Rotate and Shear
![:img a rotated and angled moon, 30%](img/shear.png)

---
# Exercise: How to rotate about the center of an object

(raise your cards!)

- A: Translate, rotate, translate
- B: Rotate, Translate, Rotate
- C: Scale, Rotate, Scale
- D: Rotate

???
XX define exercise
maybe put this after android stuff?

# Coordinate Transformations

Can modify any shape, including text

To fully understand, need matrix algebra

But Android helps with this by providing methods in the [Canvas](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/Canvas) object such as
```java
scale(float, float)
translate(float, float)
rotate(float)
```
and to combine matrices:
```java
concat(Matrix)
```

???
– Affine transformations are based on two-dimensional matrices of the
following form:

P' = T*P where P is 1x3 and T is the transform matrix (3x3) with the
bottom row 0 0 1
Thus, x' = ax + cy + t_x and y' = bx + dy + t_y
*Note* Any sequence of transform, rotate and shear can be represented
in a single matrix of this form (just multiple the matrices together)

# What is the [Paint](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/Paint.html) Object?

- Abstraction that determines how drawing operations should look
```java
drawPaint = new Paint();
drawPaint.setColor(Color.BLUE);
drawPaint.setAntiAlias(true);
drawPaint.setStrokeWidth(5);
drawPaint.setStyle(Paint.Style.STROKE);
drawPaint.setStrokeJoin(Paint.Join.ROUND);
drawPaint.setStrokeCap(Paint.Cap.ROUND);
canvas.drawCircle(50, 50, 20, drawPaint);
drawPaint.setColor(Color.GREEN);
canvas.drawCircle(50, 150, 20, drawPaint);
```

---

# What is the [Paint](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/Paint.html) Object?

- Abstraction that determines how drawing operations should look
  - Drawing style: stroked, filled
  - Line Characteristics: color, line width, join, cap styles
  - Fill Characteristics (color)

# Other Paint properties

- Text Characteristics: font family, style, size, alignment settings, etc.

--
- font: shapes for chars (called *glyphs*) plus layout
  - family or typeface

- font: shapes for chars (called *glyphs*) plus layout
  - family or typeface
  - style: plain, *italic*, **bold**, **_both_**, ~strikethrough~,  *etc.*
--

  - points: 72.27 points per inch
???
because french inches were different (72 per inch)
Really just a guideline these days
It is the *width* of a capital M (no height specified)

---
# Text quirks

- Each glyph has a reference point that defines a baseline
- Each glyph has an advance width (distance to next glyph's reference point)

![:img examples of reference point and advance width,40%](img/reference.png)
---
# Text quirks

- Each glyph has a reference point that defines a baseline
- Each glyph has an advance width (distance to next glyph's reference point)
- font has standard ascent and descent

![:img letter p with ascent and descent marked,60%](img/ascent.png)

# Text quirks

- Each glyph has a reference point that defines a baseline
- Each glyph has an advance width (distance to next glyph's reference point)
- Font has standard ascent and descent
- Font has 'leading' (distance between lines)

--
# Why am I telling you all this?

- Where is (0,0) of text when you call [drawText()](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/Canvas.html#drawText(java.lang.CharSequence,%20int,%20int,%20float,%20float,%20android.graphics.Paint)? 
- What should you set up in [Paint](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/Paint)? 
---
# Other Paint properties

- Transparency and composition characteristics: Alpha value and `xfermode`([Porter-Duff](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/PorterDuffXfermode))
???
When the alpha channel is 1, the image is fully there, when it is 0,
the image isn’t there at all, and when it is in between, the image is
partially there. In other words, the alpha channel describes the shape
of the image, it does not describe opacity. The way to think of images
with an alpha channel is as irregularly shaped pieces of cardboard,
not as colored glass.

![:img Both should be pink and source orange and dest red, 10%](img/colordodge-diagram.png)
![:img result: pink triangle with blue and,10%](img/colordodge-both.png)
???
Dest blend mode, atop source, limited to pixels in dest, colors blue and orange
Color Dodge blend mode, pixels from both kept, colors pink and blue and orange

The general formula is an area weighted average:

Asrc⋅[s]+Adest⋅[d]+Aboth⋅B(s,d)

where [s] and [d] are the source and destination colors respectively
or 0, and B(s,d) can be chosen from a set of formulas

alpha channel is
Asrc⋅[as]+Adest⋅[ad]+Aboth⋅[ab]

where [ab] is determined by the blend mode. 
---
# The Path Object

- Canvas supports drawing primitive shapes _and_ arbitrary paths
```java
  void drawPath(Path p, Paint paint);
```

--

- Declaring a `Path` can be done by combining basic primitive shapes (e.g rectangles, circles, ovals, curves like arc, cubic, etc.)

--

- What drawing model does this correspond to?
 - A (Pixel model)
 - B (Path model)

--

- Which is more scalable?
 - A (Pixel model)
 - B (Path model)

# Animation becoming core pillar of UX design

Greater awareness of role for communicating UI behavior
Guide, provide context, delight, engage

.quote[‘Animation is increasingly becoming an important part of the UI
design experience. Google’s material design guidelines are a good
illustration of this. Expect to see even more tools and optimisations
made to improve the production workflow and performance in browsers
and on devices.’ (Weareathlon)]
---
# Using Animation Well

- Used sparingly and understandingly, animation can enhance the interface … otherwise can distract!
- Need to mimic real world
- Observing motion tells us about size, weight, rigidity
- No abrupt changes in velocity!

---
# Main implementation approach

Frame-based 
- Redraw scene at regular intervals
- Developer defines redraw function

Transition-based (Hudson & Stasko '93)
- Specify property values of animation transition speed and process
 - Uses 'pacing' functions to stylize animation, e.g. slow-in
slow-out (see [easings.net](http://easings.net))
- Typically computed via __interpolation__
```java
step(fraction){x_now = x_start + fraction*(x_end - x_start);}
```
- Timing and redraw managed by toolkit
