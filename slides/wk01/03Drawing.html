# Discussion of Reading quiz

- Discuss
???
discuss with your neighbor based on the reading what does the
toolkit need to know to draw this 
- what to draw; where to draw it
- what are good abstractions for this?
- Hierarchy normally reflects spatial containment relationships

--

- Deconstruct

???

- deconstruct this interface into an interactor hierarchy

---
# More complex example

![:img Picture of a messaging interface with two messages in it, 30%](img/messaging.png)

---
# How is the tree used for drawing?
- Programmer:
 - Build and interface == build an interactor hierarchy
 - Change an interface == change the interactor hierarchy (or its --
 - parameters)
--

- Toolkit:
 - Draw an interface == walk the tree and draw things
 - Update an interface == walk the tree, clip, translate, redraw()
 - Deliver input == walk the tree and deliver events (TBD)
--

- Widgets:
 - Receive redraw()
 - Show feedback (how?)
 - Respond to input 
 - Send notifications of model changes

???
HTML is like this too

---
# Drawing on the Screen
- What is a Graphics object and how do you draw on it?
- Importance of pixel vs stroke model
- Making it pretty: Buffering & Anti Aliasing
???
- Talk about canvas, graphics object, object for each thing, etc Efficiencies?
- Mention redraw
- Discuss inconsistencies across toolkits -- whorfian effects again

---
# Drawing in Android

- `Canvas` is an object level abstraction for performing drawing operations
--

- All drawing should be done in `protected void onDraw(Canvas canvas) {...}`
---
# How does Canvas work?

- Drawing is done by calling methods for different kinds of objects
--

- For example: `drawRect`, `drawOval`, `drawLine`, `drawPath` ...

  [Full List in the API Documentation](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/Canvas.html)

---
# How does Canvas work?

- Drawing is done by calling methods for different kinds of objects

- Keeps track of other related operations

--
  - Links drawing operations to a `Bitmap` (Frame Buffer of pixels)

--

  - Handles __clipping__ of drawing boundaries

???
Clipping is super efficient if limited to a rectangle
Implications for GUI design
--

  - Performs __transformations__ on drawn visual elements

---
# Work through clipping example (bell)
.left[
- For draw
- For redraw
]

# Coordinate Transformations in Android

```java
  Canvas c = new Canvas();

  // Set the drawing boundary
  c.setClippingRect(100, 50, 200, 100);

  // Draw the shape
  c.drawRect(0, 0, 50, 50);

  // Move origin to where shape's top-left corner is
  c.translate(100, 50);

  // Draw another Rect inside the Rect just drawn
  c.drawRect(10,10,10,10);

  // Return state back to before the translation & clipping
  c.restore();
```

---
# Coordinate Transformations

Linear (“affine”) transformation

– Translate, Scale, Rotate, Shear (and any combination thereof)

--

- Translate: Move origin (and everything else) in x and y

???
used extensively in GUIS because child objects just draw themselves
at *their* origin, so a widget doesn't have to calculate how to draw
itself based on its position

--

- Scale: change size (negative == flip)
![:img a large and small moon, 15%](img/scale.png)

--

- Rotate and Shear
![:img a rotated and angled moon, 30%](img/shear.png)

---
# Exercise: How to rotate about the center of an object

- A: Translate, rotate, translate
- B: Rotate, Translate, Rotate
- C: Scale, Rotate, Scale
- D: Rotate

???
XX define exercise
maybe put this after android stuff?
---

# Coordinate Transformations

Can modify any shape, including text

To fully understand, need matrix algebra

But Android helps with this by providing methods in the [Canvas](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/Canvas) object such as
```java
scale(float, float)
translate(float, float)
rotate(float)
```
and to combine matrices:
```java
concat(Matrix)
```

???
– Affine transformations are based on two-dimensional matrices of the
following form:

P' = T*P where P is 1x3 and T is the transform matrix (3x3) with the
bottom row 0 0 1
Thus, x' = ax + cy + t_x and y' = bx + dy + t_y
*Note* Any sequence of transform, rotate and shear can be represented
in a single matrix of this form (just multiple the matrices together)

# What is the [Paint](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/Paint.html) Object?

- Abstraction that determines how drawing operations should look
```java
drawPaint = new Paint();
drawPaint.setColor(Color.BLUE);
drawPaint.setAntiAlias(true);
drawPaint.setStrokeWidth(5);
drawPaint.setStyle(Paint.Style.STROKE);
drawPaint.setStrokeJoin(Paint.Join.ROUND);
drawPaint.setStrokeCap(Paint.Cap.ROUND);
canvas.drawCircle(50, 50, 20, drawPaint);
drawPaint.setColor(Color.GREEN);
canvas.drawCircle(50, 150, 20, drawPaint);
```

---

# What is the [Paint](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/Paint.html) Object?

- Abstraction that determines how drawing operations should look
  - Drawing style: stroked, filled
  - Line Characteristics: color, line width, join, cap styles
  - Fill Characteristics (color)

![:img example dotted line--unfilled,15%](img/dotted.png)
![:img example solid filled,15%](img/filled.png)
![:img example solid unfilled,15%](img/unfilled.png)

---

# Other Paint properties

- Text Characteristics: font family, style, size, alignment settings, etc.

--
- font: shapes for chars (called *glyphs*) plus layout
  - family or typeface

![:img examples of different types of fonts,60%](img/fonts.png)

---
# Other Paint properties

- Text Characteristics: font family, style, size, alignment settings,
etc.
- font: shapes for chars (called *glyphs*) plus layout
  - family or typeface
  - style: plain, *italic*, **bold**, **_both_**, ~strikethrough~,  *etc.*
--

  - points: 72.27 points per inch
???
because french inches were different (72 per inch)
Really just a guideline these days
It is the *width* of a capital M (no height specified)

---
# Text quirks

- Each glyph has a reference point that defines a baseline
- Each glyph has an advance width (distance to next glyph's reference point)

![:img examples of reference point and advance width,40%](img/reference.png)
---
# Text quirks

- Each glyph has a reference point that defines a baseline
- Each glyph has an advance width (distance to next glyph's reference point)
- font has standard ascent and descent

![:img letter p with ascent and descent marked,60%](img/ascent.png)
---
# Text quirks

- Each glyph has a reference point that defines a baseline
- Each glyph has an advance width (distance to next glyph's reference point)
- Font has standard ascent and descent
- Font has 'leading' (distance between lines)

--
# Why am I telling you all this?

- Where is (0,0) of text when you call [drawText()](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/Canvas.html#drawText(java.lang.CharSequence,%20int,%20int,%20float,%20float,%20android.graphics.Paint)? 
- What should you set up in [Paint](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/Paint)? 
---
# Other Paint properties

- Transparency and composition characteristics: Alpha value and `xfermode`([Porter-Duff](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/PorterDuffXfermode))
???
When the alpha channel is 1, the image is fully there, when it is 0,
the image isn’t there at all, and when it is in between, the image is
partially there. In other words, the alpha channel describes the shape
of the image, it does not describe opacity. The way to think of images
with an alpha channel is as irregularly shaped pieces of cardboard,
not as colored glass.

![:img destination image with & on transparent background,10%](img/dest.png)
![:img diagram of pixel relationships,10%](img/diagram.png)
--

- Each type of pixel can be treated differently.

<br>![:img Both should be blue and source red, 10%](img/destatop-diagram.png)
![:img result: just part shows,10%](img/destatop.png)
![:img Both should be pink and source orange and dest red, 10%](img/colordodge-diagram.png)
![:img result: pink triangle with blue and,10%](img/colordodge-both.png)
???
Dest blend mode, atop source, limited to pixels in dest, colors blue and orange
Color Dodge blend mode, pixels from both kept, colors pink and blue and orange

The general formula is an area weighted average:

Asrc⋅[s]+Adest⋅[d]+Aboth⋅B(s,d)

where [s] and [d] are the source and destination colors respectively
or 0, and B(s,d) can be chosen from a set of formulas

alpha channel is
Asrc⋅[as]+Adest⋅[ad]+Aboth⋅[ab]

where [ab] is determined by the blend mode. 
---
# The Path Object

- Canvas supports drawing primitive shapes _and_ arbitrary paths
```java
  void drawPath(Path p, Paint paint);
```

--

- Declaring a `Path` can be done by combining basic primitive shapes (e.g rectangles, circles, ovals, curves like arc, cubic, etc.)

--

- What drawing model does this correspond to?
 - A (Pixel model)
 - B (Path model)

--

- Which is more scalable?
 - A (Pixel model)
 - B (Path model)
