# Lecture Structure
Reading, Discussion and Exercises in lectures
- Emphasis on active learning
- Class attendance (and quizzes) instead of midterm
- No other way to get this material
- XX final exam??

---
# A typical week includes
- **Monday/Wednesday/Friday:** <br/>Come to class ready
for discussion and activity
- **Tuesday/Thursday/Weekends:** <br/> Do your reading [~10 mins]
- **Wednesday:** <br/>Typically homework due date/assignment date
- **Thursday:** <br/>Come to lab ready to work on your homework

Stay on top of reading  to make time  for homework!

# Language: Java
Java is our primary language
- Need 143 or equivalent
- Comfortable in Java
- We will use trees, state machines, etc.
---

# Platform: Android

## Android Versioning

![:img Android Versioning and Distribution, 65%](img/android-versions-oct2018.png)

.center[
### We're going to target   - XX update to correct version & name -- .red[Oreo] :) - That's .red[__21%__] of devices, and growing]
--- 
## Android Versioning
- We encourage you to buy an android phone (no tablets) ~$50
- Need sufficient memory/disk space to run <br/>
Android Studio & emulators
- Ask questions on Piazza if you need more guidance
]
---

# Where to find what
- We use [github](https://github.com/jmankoff/interaction) extensively
- We will use Piazza for course discussions
- We will use Canvas for the course schedule <br/>
and link to everything
else from there
- Office hours will be posted on Piazza<br/>
but are also by appointment

# Expectations
- **Background**: Lots of programming expected
- **Sharing**:
 - Many assignments done in pairs
 - Outside of that, documentation is key
---

# Expectations
- **Accessibility**: This course is accessible
- **Inclusivity**: An important value in this class, and in HCI!
- **Language**: I am Jen, or Prof. Mankoff.
- **Pronouns**: She/her.

  If you run into problems, or have preferences about these issues, please tell me!

- Implementing best practices: Undo, Accessibility, Feedback, Errors,
*etc.*
- Exploration of advanced UI concepts: Ubicomp, Sensing, AR, *etc.*
---

# Course learning goals:
  Iterative Design

# Assignment Structure
Projects: Implementation of Interfaces
- Practical help with assignments in lab
- Code tested with unit tests
- Applications tested through user studies you run
- Some basics handled in code review
---

# Exercise: Your own 'Doodle' (solo)
Learning goals
- Demonstrate that you got android working
- Demonstrate basic knowledge of graphics methods for drawing things
on screen

Grading
- Exercises are Pass/Fail only
- Exercises are auto graded
---

<!-- ## First Project: Your own 'Doodle' -->
<!-- - 50% Load images/draw/write text on screen -->
<!--  - implement 3 methods to do this -->
<!--  - we will grade using test cases -->
<!--  - source code required -->
<!-- - 40% Make it look nice -->
<!--  - Make something you're proud of -->
<!--  - Challenge option: Add animation  -->
<!--  - Peer graded (with APK only) -->
<!-- - 10% Turned in on time, passes code review -->
<!-- </section> -->

# Exercise: Build a Widget (solo)
Learning goals: Create a layout to a spec
 - Reproduce three layouts we give you
 - Should position things as shown in the image
 - Should resize appropriately if phone is turned

---

# First Project: Implement and run a user study (pair)
Learning goals: End to end application; Interacting with users
- Reproduce an application
- Record data to spec
- Produce plausible results (within expected ranges)
<!-- - 50% Application meets specs -->
<!--  - Running tests generates data file properly -->
<!-- - 40% User study meets specs -->
<!--  - Correct results handed in -->
<!--  - Data analysis produces plausible numbers -->
<!-- - 10% Turned in on time, passes code review -->

Grading
- Grading is based on test cases and peer review

---

# Exercise: Make an application accessible (solo)
Learning goals: Android Accessibility
- Use Android accessibility features
- Identify accessibility problems
- Understand Android accessibility limitations
---

# Exercise: Implement support for Undo (solo)
Learning goals: Undo Abstractions
- Command objects
- Separation of concerns
- Build
---

# Exercise: Implement support for sensing (solo)
Learning goals: Using android sensors
- Using the Aware api
- Use location
- Data storage and loading
---

# Third Project: Implement an context aware app (pair)
[Or an AR game like pokemon go that uses location]
Learning goals: Design context-aware application, Heuristic Eval
- Reproduce an application
- Collect data using Heuristic Evaluation
- Iterate

# Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)
A science of the artificial
- Human
 - Anyone impacted by the existence of the program
 - end users
- Computer
 - Artificial thing human is interacting with
- Interaction
 - How the artificial stuff is actually used
 - 48% of app code [Myers & Rosson, CHI'92]; probably more now!

# HCI in the Present
Discussion: How is it changing us as individuals and a society?

???
- Social networking has been implicated in revolutions and elections.
- Interfaces designs have impacted health and safety.
---


# HCI in the Future
How do we invent a preferable future? an inclusive future?
- What will the future look like?
- Who needs to help design the future for us to achieve this?
- Who needs to use technology in the future for us to achieve this?
