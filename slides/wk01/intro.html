# Jennifer Mankoff
[Make4All Lab](http://make4all.org)

I use techonology to improving inclusion in
and accessibility of our digital future. 

- Assistive and health technology
- Fabrication/Physical computing
- Improve inclusion and accessibility

More about me:
- This is my third Faculty position! (previously Berkeley & CMU)
- I also play the viola
- I have two teen-aged budding computer scientists. My daughter likes
to test out and critique my classes. 

Please contact me through Piazza so that all course communication is
in one place

Office hours: 2-3:3 on Wednesdays. I'm also usually in my office doing
prep in the hour before class.

.title[Android Versioning]

.body[
- We encourage you to buy an android phone (no tablets)  ~$50
- Need sufficient memory/disk space to run <br/>
Android Studio & emulators<h2></h2>
- Ask questions on Piazza if you need more guidance
]

.title[Where to find what]
.body[
- The class is on the [web]({{site.url}}/interaction),
  but we have used iframes to connect this to
  [Canvas]({{site.canvas}}). We try to interlink
  everything as much as possible.
- Class discussions and all contact with instructors should happen
either in office hours or through [Piazza]({{site.piazza}})
 - I will be calling them about a privacy issue today; possibility we
   will use canvas instead
- You can also request appointments for further help
- Assignments can be downloaded from the class [gitlab]({{site.gitlab}})
