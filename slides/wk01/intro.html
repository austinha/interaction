More about me:
- This is my third Faculty position! (previously Berkeley & CMU)
- I also play the viola
- I have two teen-aged budding computer scientists. My daughter likes
to test out and critique my classes. 

Please contact me through Piazza so that all course communication is
in one place

Office hours: 2-3:3 on Wednesdays. I'm also usually in my office doing
prep in the hour before class.

Reading, Discussion and Exercises in lectures
- Emphasis on active learning

Class attendance
- STRONGLY encouraged
- Panopto recordings won't give you the chance do in-class work
- Class *engagement* and *performance* both influence grading

Exams
- Midterm: Date still TBD
- Final Exam: June 10th.

.title[A typical week includes]
.body[
- **Monday/Wednesday/Friday:** <br/>Come to class ready
for discussion and activity
- **Tuesday/Thursday/Weekends:** <br/> Do your reading [~10 mins]
- **Wednesday:** <br/>Typically homework due date/assignment date
- **Thursday:** <br/>Come to lab ready to work on your homework

Stay on top of reading  to make time  for homework!

.title[Where to find what]
.body[
- The class is on the [web]({{site.url}}/interaction),
  but we have used iframes to connect this to
  [Canvas]({{site.canvas}}). We try to interlink
  everything as much as possible.
- Class discussions and all contact with instructors should happen
either in office hours or through [Piazza]({{site.piazza}})
- You can also request appointments for further help
- Assignments can be downloaded from the class [gitlab]({{site.gitlab}})

Whorfian Effects
- The way in which our tools influence how we think and thus what we do. 

- Origins are linguistic (e.g. the way in which language about color affects what we perceive)

- Can even affect perception of human emotion!

.title[ But we look at General Principals]
.body[

Particular toolkits tend to be mired in a particular platform

Along comes the next big thing  (e.g., iPhone) and you’ll need to
learn a new one 

Labs are platform specific looks at lecture concepts 

If you learn the structures/concepts (and esp. rationale behind them)
that survives change better
