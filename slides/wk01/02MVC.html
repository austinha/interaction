# Basic Structure of Interaction
Discussion of readings:
- Model View Controller 
- Relationship to Android software stack
???
- Input -- we need to know when people are doing things. This needs to be event driven.
- Output -- we need to show people feedback. This cannot ‘take over’ i.e. it needs to be multi threaded
- Back end -- we need to be able to talk to the application. 
- State machine -- we need to keep track of state. 
- What don’t we need? We don’t need to know about the rest of the UI, probably, etc etc
- Model View Controller -- this works within interactors (draw diagram), but also represents the overall structure (ideally) of a whole user interface
- NOTE: Be careful to write any new vocabulary words on the board and define as they come up.
