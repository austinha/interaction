# Relating the Human and the Machine

- Gulf of Execution and Gulf of Evaluation
- Relation to Mental model formation

???
consider starting this discussion in german
Talk about how the mental model builds up
Build up a list of good UI design principals from these basics
- Undo
- Predictability
- ...
What is missing? (e.g. fun
---

#Reading quiz

---

# In class Exercise

- Brainstorm a list of common interactors
- Diagram them wrt reading

---
# What about a whole interface

# Model View Controller

???
- Input -- we need to know when people are doing things. This needs to be event driven.
- Output -- we need to show people feedback. This cannot ‘take over’ i.e. it needs to be multi threaded
- Back end -- we need to be able to talk to the application. 
- State machine -- we need to keep track of state. 
- What don’t we need? We don’t need to know about the rest of the UI, probably, etc etc
- Model View Controller -- this works within interactors (draw diagram), but also represents the overall structure (ideally) of a whole user interface
- NOTE: Be careful to write any new vocabulary words on the board and define as they come up.

## Introduction to Android

- Applications typically follow MVP architecture

--

  - Model, View, Presenter

--

---
## Android Applications

- __Intents__

--

  - Launch components (and provide them with data)

--
  - Not limited to components of the same app
    - Meaning: your components can be started by intents from other applications

--
- Components

--

  - Activity
  - Service
  - Broadcast Receiver
  - Content Providers

---
## Activity
  - [`android.app.Activity`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity)

--
  - Represents a single interface

--
  - Example: Activities for Gmail App
    - Inbox, Message Compose, Spam Folder, etc.
--
  - Activities can be started by other applications, if desired
    - E.g., sharing a photo by email starts Gmail's Message Compose activity

---
## Activity

]

---
## Service
  - [`android.app.Service`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Service)

--
  - Entry point for background processes

--
  - Example: Spotify's player activity uses a service to play music
    - Could be done by activity alone
--
    - Use of a service allows music to continue when player activity is no longer in the foreground
--
  - Services may be killed and restarted as required by the OS
    - A persistent service such as music playback may use a persistent notification to prevent this

---
## Broadcast Receivers
  - [`android.content.BroadcastReceiver`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/BroadcastReceiver.html)

--
  - Entry point for events outside of regular userflow

--
  - Example: Alarms
    - Application schedules callback with OS in 10 minutes
--
    - In the meantime, the application can be killed
--
    - 10 minutes later, the OS broadcasts the callback event to the app
--
    - App begins playing sound; vibrating

---
## Content Providers
  - [`android.content.ContentProvider`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/ContentProvider)

--
  - Persistent storage of data

--
  - Supports multiple backends, depending on app permissions
    - Local filesystem, web, SQLite DB, etc.
--
  - Can permit access to other applications
    - Contacts can be read and written to by other apps, depending on permissions
