Sketch out key concepts 
- Input -- we need to know when people are doing things. This needs to be event driven.
- Output -- we need to show people feedback. This cannot ‘take over’ i.e. it needs to be multi threaded
- Back end -- we need to be able to talk to the application. 
- State machine -- we need to keep track of state. 
- What don’t we need? We don’t need to know about the rest of the UI, probably, etc etc
- Model View Controller -- this works within components (draw diagram), but also represents the overall structure (ideally) of a whole user interface
- NOTE: Be careful to write any new vocabulary words on the board and define as they come up.

# How does an application know what to draw?

12:30pm. Video call between them, 70%](img/interface.png)


- Discuss
???
discuss with your neighbor based on the reading what does the
toolkit need to know to draw this 
- what to draw; where to draw it
- what are good abstractions for this?
- Hierarchy normally reflects spatial containment relationships

--

- Deconstruct

 - Let's list all the components... and arrange them in a tree
 
???

- deconstruct this interface into an interactor hierarchy

# How is the tree used for drawing?
- Programmer:
 - Build and interface == build an interactor hierarchy
 - Change an interface == change the interactor hierarchy (or its --
 - parameters)
--

- Toolkit:
 - Draw an interface == walk the tree and draw things
 - Update an interface == walk the tree, clip, translate, redraw()
 - Deliver input == walk the tree and deliver events (TBD)
--

- Components:
 - Receive redraw()
 - Show feedback (how?)
 - Respond to input 
 - Send notifications of model changes

???
HTML is like this too

---
---
# How does Canvas work?

  - Handles __clipping__ of drawing boundaries

???
Clipping is super efficient if limited to a rectangle
Implications for GUI design
--

  - Performs __transformations__ on drawn visual elements

---
# Work through clipping example (bell)

- For draw
- For redraw

# Coordinate Transformations in Android

```java
  Canvas c = new Canvas();

  // Set the drawing boundary
  c.setClippingRect(100, 50, 200, 100);

  // Draw the shape
  c.drawRect(0, 0, 50, 50);

  // Move origin to where shape's top-left corner is
  c.translate(100, 50);

  // Draw another Rect inside the Rect just drawn
  c.drawRect(10,10,10,10);

  // Return state back to before the translation & clipping
  c.restore();
```

Which of the following must a parent component do before passing a
drawable region to the child? [raise your hands]

- [a] Translate (child.x, child.y)
- [b] Clip(parent.x, parent.y, parent.w, parent.h)
- [c] Translate (-child.x, -child.y)
- [d] Clip(0,0,child.w,child.h)
