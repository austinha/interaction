# Today's goals

- __Gulf of Evaluation/Execution__
- Mental models
- Common Components
- Component Anatomy
- Relate to Android

# Relating the Human and the Machine

- Gulf of Execution and Gulf of Evaluation
- Relation to Mental model formation

???
consider starting this discussion in german
Talk about how the mental model builds up
Build up a list of good UI design principals from these basics
- Undo
- Predictability
- ...
What is missing? (e.g. fun)
---
# Causes of Gulf of Evaluation
???
- Hard to understand visual feedback
- Poor use of colors
- Bad layout, poor grouping
- Unfamiliar display of information
- Unfamiliar design patterns, or doesn’t follow convention
- Forcing people to remember lots of things
- Lack of feedback in response to inputs
- Might not see visual updates
- Can’t find info on screen 
- Might look same as unimportant
- Irrelevant info on screen / important info missing
---
# Causes of Gulf of Execution
???
- Unfamiliar devices and inputs
- Don’t know what is possible
- Unfamiliar GUI components 
- Solvable with experience
- Unfamiliar interaction patterns
- Also solvable with experience
- Example patterns: Dialogs, Shopping Carts

# Discussion of reading quiz

# In class Exercise

- Brainstorm a list of common widgets
???
Menu, Button(types), Slider, Scrollbar, Spinner, List box, Icon, Link,
Text box, Label,
---
# Widget (Component) Model

__Encapsulate interactive components__ (widgets)
- Component library (button, slider, container)
- Interface built as a hierarchy of components

__Components drawn by underlying graphics library__
- Input event generation and dispatch
- Historically mouse & keyboard, now touch, ...

__Bounds management & damage/redraw__
Model geometry, redraw updated regions only

# Exercise continued
- Brainstorm a list of common components
- Pick One (Button)
- Diagram it with respect to reading
 - Model
 - View
 - Controller

# What about a whole interface

![:img Minimalist Recipe App showing the title 'simple food', a heart

a picture of an egg, and a description of what you need to boil an egg

## Model View Controller

???
Sketch out key concepts 
- Input -- we need to know when people are doing things. This needs to be event driven.
- Output -- we need to show people feedback. This cannot ‘take over’ i.e. it needs to be multi threaded
- Back end -- we need to be able to talk to the application. 
- State machine -- we need to keep track of state. 
- What don’t we need? We don’t need to know about the rest of the UI, probably, etc etc
- Model View Controller -- this works within components (draw diagram), but also represents the overall structure (ideally) of a whole user interface
- NOTE: Be careful to write any new vocabulary words on the board and define as they come up.

# Assignment 1

- Running sample code for [Assignment 1: Doodle](/assignments/doodle.html)
- Example: `addImage`
- Understanding Grading
- Other Questions
---
## Environment Setup

- Should already be done: Download [Android Studo](https://developer.android.com/studio/) and install
--

- Keep default installation settings

--
  - We'll be using Oreo as a default for this class
  - But any version above Jellybean will work

## Introduction to Android

- Applications typically follow MVP architecture

--

  - Model, View, Presenter
  
--

![MVP Diagram](img/mvp-design-pattern.png)


???
- Relationship of MVC to Android software stack
- Discuss Whorfian effects

---
## Running Sample Code

- Open project in Android Studio

--

- Run configurations should be automatically imported from Gradle
  - If not, `build` should trigger an import

--

- Run with ►

--

  - Connect an android device by USB or create a new virtual device

--
  - If by USB, debugging must be enabled on the device

## Implementing  `addImage`

```java
private ImageView addImage(FrameLayout mainCanvas, String imageName, Float x, Float y, int size);
```

### Params:
- `mainCanvas`: Canvas in which to render the image.

--
- `imageName`: Filename of image to draw in `res/drawable`.

--
- `x`: Horizontal distance from top-left corner of canvas to top-left of image.
- `y`: Veritcal distance from top-left corner of canvas to top-left of image.

--
- `size`: Width and height of rendered image, in pixels.

--
### Returns:
- An `ImageView` which has been added to the canvas.

---
## Implementing  `addImage`

Break down into component steps, look up documentation, and implement

1. Create `ImageView`

--
2. Add new view to canvas

--
3. Position and set view size

--
4. Set view contents

---
## Implementing  `addImage`

```java
private ImageView addImage(FrameLayout mainCanvas, String imageName, Float x, Float y, int size) {
    // Create ImageView and add it to mainCanvas.
    ImageView imageView = new ImageView(this);
    // Add imageView to mainCanvas
    // Set imageView size and position
    // Set imageView contents using filename
    return imageView;
}
```

---
## Implementing  `addImage`

```java
private ImageView addImage(FrameLayout mainCanvas, String imageName, Float x, Float y, int size) {
    // Create ImageView and add it to mainCanvas.
    ImageView imageView = new ImageView(this);
    mainCanvas.addView(imageView);
    // Set imageView size and position
    // Set imageView contents using filename
    return imageView;
}
```

---
## Implementing  `addImage`

```java
private ImageView addImage(FrameLayout mainCanvas, String imageName, Float x, Float y, int size) {
    // Create ImageView and add it to mainCanvas.
    ImageView imageView = new ImageView(this);
    mainCanvas.addView(imageView);

    imageView.getLayoutParams().height = size;
    imageView.getLayoutParams().width = size;

    // Set imageView contents using filename
    return imageView;
}
```

```java
private ImageView addImage(FrameLayout mainCanvas, String imageName, Float x, Float y, int size) {
    // Create ImageView and add it to mainCanvas.

    mainCanvas.addView(imageView);

    imageView.getLayoutParams().height = size;
    imageView.getLayoutParams().width = size;
    imageView.setX(x);
    imageView.setY(y);

    // Set imageView contents using filename
    return imageView;
}
```
