# Relating the Human and the Machine

- Gulf of Execution and Gulf of Evaluation

Gulf of execution is the user 'error' region (user requests
  function the __system DOESNT HAVE__), gulf of
  evaluation is when the user __doesn't realize the system HAS a
functionality__.

# Significant Stagnation

- Basic GUI components invented 1970s
- Windows, Icons, Menus, Pointers (“WIMP”)
- “Perfected” by Macintosh in 1984
- Not much change since then (even with web)

## Most GUIs still use the same 7-10 interaction techniques

![:img Picture of a very old mac control panel showing typical interactors at the time,80%](img/interactors1.png)
]
???
- Work well, uniform
- Good for usability
- GUI is victim of its own success
- Opportunities lost by not customizing interaction techniques to tasks
- Hard for better techniques to get traction
- Only very recently with mobile devices (touch based) have we seen lots of new techniques get a major foothold

__Encapsulate interactive components__ (interactors)
- Component library (button, slider, container)
- Interface built as a hierarchy of components

__Components drawn by underlying graphics library__
- Input event generation and dispatch
- Historically mouse & keyboard, now touch, ...

__Bounds management & damage/redraw__
- Model geometry, redraw updated regions only

Sketch out key concepts 
- Input -- we need to know when people are doing things. This needs to be event driven.
- Output -- we need to show people feedback. This cannot ‘take over’ i.e. it needs to be multi threaded
- Back end -- we need to be able to talk to the application. 
- State machine -- we need to keep track of state. 
- What don’t we need? We don’t need to know about the rest of the UI, probably, etc etc
- Model View Controller -- this works within components (draw diagram), but also represents the overall structure (ideally) of a whole user interface
- NOTE: Be careful to write any new vocabulary words on the board and define as they come up.

This repository will contain assignment and exercise stubs for CSE340
for the Spring 2019 term. It's recommended that you [fork](https://gitlab.cs.washington.edu/cse340/19sp/forks/new) this
repository. This will allow you to merge any upstream changes we make
to stubs throughout the quarter. You can find instructions on setting
up and maintaining a forked repository [here](https://help.github.com/en/articles/working-with-forks).
