## Course Objectives
- Practical applications for learnings in lecture

--
- Understand design considerations when making mobile apps

--
- Design and implement basic Android applications

--
- Debugging in Java and for Android

---
## Android Applications

- __Intents__

--

  - Launch components (and provide them with data)

--
  - Not limited to components of the same app
    - Meaning: your components can be started by intents from other applications

--
- Components

--

  - Activity
  - Service
  - Broadcast Receiver
  - Content Providers

---
## Activity
  - [`android.app.Activity`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity)

--
  - Represents a single interface

--
  - Example: Activities for Gmail App
    - Inbox, Message Compose, Spam Folder, etc.
--
  - Activities can be started by other applications, if desired
    - E.g., sharing a photo by email starts Gmail's Message Compose activity

---
## Activity

.center[
![:img Activity Lifecycle, 40%](img/activity_lifecycle.png)
]

---
## Service
  - [`android.app.Service`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Service)

--
  - Entry point for background processes

--
  - Example: Spotify's player activity uses a service to play music
    - Could be done by activity alone
--
    - Use of a service allows music to continue when player activity is no longer in the foreground
--
  - Services may be killed and restarted as required by the OS
    - A persistent service such as music playback may use a persistent notification to prevent this

---
## Broadcast Receivers
  - [`android.content.BroadcastReceiver`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/BroadcastReceiver.html)

--
  - Entry point for events outside of regular userflow

--
  - Example: Alarms
    - Application schedules callback with OS in 10 minutes
--
    - In the meantime, the application can be killed
--
    - 10 minutes later, the OS broadcasts the callback event to the app
--
    - App begins playing sound; vibrating

---
## Content Providers
  - [`android.content.ContentProvider`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/ContentProvider)

--
  - Persistent storage of data

--
  - Supports multiple backends, depending on app permissions
    - Local filesystem, web, SQLite DB, etc.
--
  - Can permit access to other applications
    - Contacts can be read and written to by other apps, depending on permissions
---
## Android Project Structure

.center[
  ![:img Android Project Structure, 40%](img/android_project_structure.png)
]

---

## Android Project Structure

- `app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`

  - Describes application at a high level for both compilation and running
--

  - Includes app package, components, permissions, and hardware features

--

- `app/src/main/java/com.example.myapp/MainActivity.java`
  - The main activity activated when application launches

--

- `app/src/main/res/layout/activity_main.xml`
  - Declares the views and layout of the main activity

--

- `app/build.gradle`
  - Android build tool configuration file

--
  - Includes target and min SDK versions and dependencies

---
## Android Project Structure

- `drawable-<density>/`

  - Images at various pixel densities to accommodate various display resolutions
--

  - Keep filenames consistent between folders

--

- `layout/`
  - Layout XML description files for application activities
--

- `mipmap/`

  - Launcher icons for your application at various sizes and shapes

--

- `values/`

  - A good place to store constants
      - Density-independent pixel values (sizes)
      - Color
--
  - Good for string localization as well
      - Storing strings here makes it much easier to add additional languages in the future!

  ## Animation on Android

![img: Android Animation Example, 20%](img/android-animate.gif)

- Different Animation Systems
  - _Property Animation_ - preferred method; more flexible

  - _View Animation_ - simple setup; the old way (basically xml definitions x_x)

  - _Drawable Animation_ - load `Drawable` resources and display them one frame after the other (like a gif)

---

## Property Animation

- Define an animate that changes on object's property (a field on a object) over a length of time

.center[

  ![Animation Linear](img/animation-linear.png)

]

---

## Property Animation

- Animation Characteristics
  - _Duration_ - length of the animation (default is 300 ms)

  - _Time Interpolation_ - how the values are calculated as a function of the current elapsed time

  - _Repeat Count & Behavior_ - # of times to repeat and whether to restart or play in reverse, etc.

  - _Animator Sets_ - can group a set of animations into a logical set and play simultaneously or after delays

  - _Frame Refresh Delay_ - how often to refresh the frames of your animation (default is 10 ms) but **depends on how busy the system is**

---
## Property Animation

- Process of how an animation is calculated:

.center[

  ![Value Animator Process ](img/valueanimator.png)

]

---
## `ValueAnimator`

- Keeps track of the animation's timing (how long its been running and current value of property)

- Contains a `TimeInterpolator` that defines the type of interpolation for the value over time

- Contains a `TypeEvaluator` that figures out how to calculate values for the property being animated

```java
ValueAnimator animation = ValueAnimator.ofFloat(0f, 1f);
animation.setDuration(1000);
// Starts the animation
animation.start();
// TODO: need to listen for updates to get the returned value
```
---

## `ObjectAnimator`

- Rather than listening for a value, we can simply directly animate a property on an object

- **However**: the property that you are animating must have a setter function (in camel case) in the form of set<propertyName>() for this to work

```java
ObjectAnimator anim = ObjectAnimator.ofFloat(foo, "alpha", 0f, 1f);
anim.setDuration(1000);
anim.start();
```


---
## Animation Listeners (1/2)
- `Animator.AnimatorListener`
  - `onAnimationStart()` - Called when the animation starts.
  - `onAnimationEnd()` - Called when the animation ends.
  - `onAnimationRepeat()` - Called when the animation repeats itself.
  - `onAnimationCancel()` - Called when the animation is canceled.
      - **Note**: A cancelled animation also calls - `onAnimationEnd()`, regardless of how the animation were ended.

- `ValueAnimator.AnimatorUpdateListener`
  - `onAnimationUpdate()` - called on every frame of the animation. Listen to this event to use the calculated values generated by `ValueAnimator` during an animation.  

---
## Animation Listeners (2/2)

- Example using `onAnimationEnd`:

```java
// Create a fade animation that changes the alpha of an object
ValueAnimator fadeAnim = ObjectAnimator.ofFloat(newBall, "alpha", 1f, 0f);

// Set duration to be 250 ms
fadeAnim.setDuration(250);

// Add a listeners to the fade anim
fadeAnim.addListener(new AnimatorListenerAdapter() {
  // When the animation finishes remove the object from the list of balls
  public void onAnimationEnd(Animator animation) {
      balls.remove(((ObjectAnimator)animation).getTarget());
  }
});
```

---
## Multiple Simultaneous Animations

- `AnimatorSet`
```java
  // Create animator set
  AnimatorSet bouncer = new AnimatorSet();

  // Add the good stuff
  bouncer.play(bounceAnim).before(squashAnim1);
  bouncer.play(squashAnim1).with(squashAnim2);
  bouncer.play(squashAnim1).with(stretchAnim1);
  bouncer.play(squashAnim1).with(stretchAnim2);
  bouncer.play(bounceBackAnim).after(stretchAnim2);

  // Animate the alpha value from 1->0
  ValueAnimator fadeAnim = ObjectAnimator.ofFloat(newBall, "alpha", 1f, 0f);
  fadeAnim.setDuration(250);

  // Build up a another level of animation sets
  AnimatorSet animatorSet = new AnimatorSet();
  animatorSet.play(bouncer).before(fadeAnim);

  // Starts the animations
  animatorSet.start()
```

---

## There's more flexilbity... (1/3)

- You can specify `Keyframe` objects0 and to control the animation

```java
  // Key for start at 0
  Keyframe kf0 = Keyframe.ofFloat(0f, 0f);

  // Key for half way finished animation
  Keyframe kf1 = Keyframe.ofFloat(.5f, 360f);

  // Key for end state
  Keyframe kf2 = Keyframe.ofFloat(1f, 0f);

  // ValueName-to-keyframes
  PropertyValuesHolder pvhRotation = PropertyValuesHolder.ofKeyframe(
      "rotation",
      kf0,
      kf1,
      kf2);

  // Create the animation
  ObjectAnimator rotationAnim = ObjectAnimator.ofPropertyValuesHolder(
      target,
      pvhRotation)
  rotationAnim.setDuration(5000ms);

```

---

## There's more flexibility... (2/3)

- You can declare animations in XML files:

```xml
<set android:ordering="sequentially">
    <set>
        <objectAnimator
            android:propertyName="x"
            android:duration="500"
            android:valueTo="400"
            android:valueType="intType"/>
        <objectAnimator
            android:propertyName="y"
            android:duration="500"
            android:valueTo="300"
            android:valueType="intType"/>
    </set>
    <objectAnimator
        android:propertyName="alpha"
        android:duration="500"
        android:valueTo="1f"/>
</set>
```
---
## There's more flexibility... (3/3)

- You can then run the animation by doing the following:

```java
  AnimatorSet set = (AnimatorSet) AnimatorInflater.loadAnimator(myContext,
      R.anim.property_animator);
  set.setTarget(myObject);
  set.start();
```
- Note that animations xml files should be in the `res/anim/` directory

---

## What About Animating Views? (1/2)

- Steamlined process for view animation

- `View` auto-magically calls `invalidate()` when their properties are changed

- This is useful when using the `ObjectAnimator` class

---
## What About Animating Views? (2/2)

- If you want to animate a view, you need only specify one of the magic the property of the `View` class

  - `translationX` /`translationY` - view location as a delta from its top/left coordinates relative to the parent

  - `rotation` / `rotationX`/`rotationY` - control 2D rotation and 3D rotation around a pivot point

  - `scaleX` / `scaleY` - 2D scaliong of a `View` around a pivot point

  - `pivotX` / `pivotY` - changes location of thej pivot point (default is object's center)

  - `x` / `y` - utility property to describe the final location of a `View` in its container as a sum of (left, top) + `translationX`, `translationY`)

  - `alpha`

---

## Drawable Animation (1/4)

- Way of loading a series of `Drawable` resouces one after the other to create an Animation

- Similar to a gif or stop-motion animation style

- `AnimationDrawable` is the basis for `Drawable` animations

---

## Drawable Animation (2/4)
- Define the frames of your animation in an XML file that list the frames in order

- The example below is a 3 frame animation that

- To play once and hold the last frame at the end set `android:oneshot=true`

- If it is false, the animation will loop indefinitely

```xml
<animation-list xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    android:oneshot="true">
    <item android:drawable="@drawable/rocket_thrust1" android:duration="200" />
    <item android:drawable="@drawable/rocket_thrust2" android:duration="200" />
    <item android:drawable="@drawable/rocket_thrust3" android:duration="200" />
</animation-list>
```

---
## Drawable Animation (3/4)

- Now use the animation in code

```java
// Variable to hold the animation
AnimationDrawable mRocketAnimation;

public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
  super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
  setContentView(R.layout.main);
  // Grab the imageview and set the image drawable for the animation
  ImageView rocketImage = (ImageView) findViewById(R.id.rocket_image);
  rocketImage.setBackgroundResource(R.drawable.rocket_thrust);
  mRocketAnimation = (AnimationDrawable) rocketImage.getBackground();
}

public boolean onTouchEvent(MotionEvent event) {
  if (event.getAction() == MotionEvent.ACTION_DOWN) {
    // Start the animation on touch
    mRocketAnimation.start();
    return true;
  }
  return super.onTouchEvent(event);
}
```
