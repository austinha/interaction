---

## Course Objectives
- Practical applications for learnings in lecture


- Understand design considerations when making mobile apps


- Design and implement basic Android applications


- Debugging in Java and for Android

---

## Lab 1 Objectives

- Introduce the building blocks of Android applications


- Obtain the course repository


- Explore an Android project folder


- Show some basic Android debugging techniques

---
## Android Applications

- __Components__

    - Activity
    - Service
    - Broadcast Receiver
    - Content Providers

- __Intents__

  - Launch components (and provide them with data)
  - Not limited to components of the same app
    - Meaning: your components can be started by intents from other applications


---
## Activity
  - [`android.app.Activity`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity)

  - Represents a single interface

  - Example: Activities for Gmail App
    - Inbox, Message Compose, Spam Folder, etc.

  - Activities can be started by other applications, if desired
    - E.g., sharing a photo by email starts Gmail's Message Compose activity

---
## Service
  - [`android.app.Service`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Service)


  - Entry point for background processes


  - Example: Spotify's player activity uses a service to play music
    - Could be done by activity alone

    - Use of a service allows music to continue when player activity is no longer in the foreground

  - Services may be killed and restarted as required by the OS
    - A persistent service such as music playback may use a persistent notification to prevent this

---
## Broadcast Receivers
  - [`android.content.BroadcastReceiver`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/BroadcastReceiver.html)


  - Entry point for events outside of regular userflow


  - Example: Alarms
    - Application schedules callback with OS in 10 minutes

    - In the meantime, the application can be killed

    - 10 minutes later, the OS broadcasts the callback event to the app

    - App begins playing sound; vibrating

---
## Content Providers
  - [`android.content.ContentProvider`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/ContentProvider)


  - Persistent storage of data


  - Supports multiple backends, depending on app permissions
    - Local filesystem, web, SQLite DB, etc.

  - Can permit access to other applications
    - Contacts can be read and written to by other apps, depending on permissions
---
## Obtaining the Course repository

- Go to Gitlab

  - If you do not have SSH set up with Gitlab, just download the zip for now

      - Later: ['Set up an SSH key with Gitlab'](https://gitlab.cs.washington.edu/help/ssh/README#generating-a-new-ssh-key-pair)

  - Once you have SSH set up, fork the repository

## Android Project Structure

---

## Android Project Structure

- `app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`

  - Describes application at a high level for both compilation and running

  - Includes app package, components, permissions, and hardware features



- `app/src/main/java/com.example.myapp/MainActivity.java`

  - The main activity activated when application launches



- `app/build.gradle`

  - Android build tool configuration file

  - Includes target and min SDK versions and dependencies


- `app/src/main/res/layout/activity_main.xml`

  - Declares the views and layout of the main activity

---
## Android Project Structure

- `drawable-<density>/`

  - Images at various pixel densities to accommodate various display resolutions

  - Keep filenames consistent between folders



- `layout/`

  - Layout XML description files for application activities


- `mipmap/`

  - Launcher icons for your application at various sizes and shapes



- `values/`

  - A good place to store constants
      - Density-independent pixel values (sizes)
      - Color

  - Good for string localization as well
      - Storing strings here makes it much easier to add additional languages in the future!
