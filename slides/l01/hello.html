## Course Objectives
- Practical applications for learnings in lecture

--
- Understand design considerations when making mobile apps

--
- Design and implement basic Android applications

--
- Debugging in Java and for Android

---
## Android Applications

- __Intents__

--

  - Launch components (and provide them with data)

--
  - Not limited to components of the same app
    - Meaning: your components can be started by intents from other applications

--
- Components

--

  - Activity
  - Service
  - Broadcast Receiver
  - Content Providers

---
## Activity
  - [`android.app.Activity`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity)

--
  - Represents a single interface

--
  - Example: Activities for Gmail App
    - Inbox, Message Compose, Spam Folder, etc.
--
  - Activities can be started by other applications, if desired
    - E.g., sharing a photo by email starts Gmail's Message Compose activity

---
## Activity

---
## Service
  - [`android.app.Service`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Service)

--
  - Entry point for background processes

--
  - Example: Spotify's player activity uses a service to play music
    - Could be done by activity alone
--
    - Use of a service allows music to continue when player activity is no longer in the foreground
--
  - Services may be killed and restarted as required by the OS
    - A persistent service such as music playback may use a persistent notification to prevent this

---
## Broadcast Receivers
  - [`android.content.BroadcastReceiver`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/BroadcastReceiver.html)

--
  - Entry point for events outside of regular userflow

--
  - Example: Alarms
    - Application schedules callback with OS in 10 minutes
--
    - In the meantime, the application can be killed
--
    - 10 minutes later, the OS broadcasts the callback event to the app
--
    - App begins playing sound; vibrating

---
## Content Providers
  - [`android.content.ContentProvider`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/ContentProvider)

--
  - Persistent storage of data

--
  - Supports multiple backends, depending on app permissions
    - Local filesystem, web, SQLite DB, etc.
--
  - Can permit access to other applications
    - Contacts can be read and written to by other apps, depending on permissions
---
## Android Project Structure

  ![:img Android Project Structure, 40%](img/android_project_structure.png)
]

---

## Android Project Structure

- `app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`

  - Describes application at a high level for both compilation and running
--

  - Includes app package, components, permissions, and hardware features

--

- `app/src/main/java/com.example.myapp/MainActivity.java`
  - The main activity activated when application launches

--

- `app/src/main/res/layout/activity_main.xml`
  - Declares the views and layout of the main activity

--

- `app/build.gradle`
  - Android build tool configuration file

--
  - Includes target and min SDK versions and dependencies

---
## Android Project Structure

- `drawable-<density>/`

  - Images at various pixel densities to accommodate various display resolutions
--

  - Keep filenames consistent between folders

--

- `layout/`
  - Layout XML description files for application activities
--

- `mipmap/`

  - Launcher icons for your application at various sizes and shapes

--

- `values/`

  - A good place to store constants
      - Density-independent pixel values (sizes)
      - Color
--
  - Good for string localization as well
      - Storing strings here makes it much easier to add additional languages in the future!
