.title[Comments on Feedback]
.body[
Thanks for the feedback on the class!
- Quizzes show. Assignments are taking a long time. We will try to post information
about expected time, please reach out for help if you go beyond that

- Start early (some people are starting ColorPicker today), so you can ask us for help with time to spare!

.title[Enums]
.body[

Group of named constants

- Used for PPS in colorPicker (PPS States; Essential Geometry)

- Used for PPS in Menu assignment *and* for experimental conditions

- Easy to inspect if you want to (we do this in ExperimentSession)

.title[Custom Listeners]
.body[
- Used in ColorPicker and Menus. You'll use them lots
- Why create custom listeners?
]
--
.body[
 - Let you execute code when your view's model has changed
 - No other way to know that has happened

]

---
.title[How to implement]
.body[

Custom View needs
- To define the custom interface 
- To keep track of listeners
]
--
.body[
Anything using the view needs
- To implement the interface (specifically, the method that will be called)
- To register itself as a listener
]
---
.title[Example Custom View -- ColorPicker: We setup the Custom View side for you]
.body[
```java
    /** Currently registered ColorListener instance or null. */
    protected ColorListener mColorListener;

    /**
     * Class which defines a listener to be called when a new color is selected.
     */
    public interface ColorListener {
        void onColorSelected(@ColorInt int color);
    }

    /**
     * Registers a new listener for the color of this ColorPicker, or replaces
     * any existing listener.
     *
     * @param colorListener New listener or null.
     */
    public final void setColorListener(@Nullable ColorListener colorListener) {
        mColorListener = colorListener;
    }
```

.title[You need to do this yourself in Menus]

.body[

```java
 /**
     * You need to create a listener interface so the application
     * can be notified when a selection is made. This will trigger
     * the move to the next trial.
     */
    protected MenuExperimentViewSolution.MenuListener menuListener;
```
]
---
.title[Example Custom Listener -- ColorPicker: You need to implement
this]

.body[
`// TODO: Register callback to update {color,label} View when color changed.`

What method do we call to register the callback?  setColorListener

What method is called when?

What do we usually do in a callback? update application state

.title[Listener in Menus]
.body[
`setMenuListener` needs to be implemented, should

- record the result of that trial
- Update the experiment to show the next menu (or nothing if the
session is over)
- Update the instructions to the user

- Fitts Law (compare distance and size; check for infinite size)

What analysis methods can we use to predict?
