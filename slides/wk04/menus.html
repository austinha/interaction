.title[Which is better and Why?]
.body[

What analysis methods can we use to predict?

- Fitts Law (compare distance and size; check for infinite distance)
- Steering Law (distance and size over a path)
- Cognitive modeling (complex multi-step model of expert behavior)
 - Does someone have to 'check' something? More than once?
 - Do they have to move? More than once
- Gestalt Psychology (will they see it at all?)
- Errors (will they be reduced)
