.title[Metaphor]
.right-column[
Lakoff & Johnson, Metaphors We Live By

.quote[“...the way we think, what we experience, and what we do every day
is very much a matter of metaphor.” ]

For example, until I had chickens I never noticed all the chicken
metaphors in our language:

- “A hen is only an egg's way of making another egg.” - Samuel Butler
- “The key to everything is patience. You get the chicken by hatching the egg, not by smashing it.” - unknown
- "Regard it as just as desirable to build a chicken house as to build a cathedral." - Frank Lloyd Wright
- "A chicken in every pot" - 1928 Republican Party campaign slogan
- "Don't have a pot to put it in" - 1928 Democratic Party response slogan
- Nest egg - to save a little money each week
- Scratching out a living - to earn enough to get by on
- Don't count your chickens before they hatch - don't plan on an outcome before it actually happens.
- Don't put all your eggs in one basket - don't plan on an outcome before it actually happens.
- Feather your nest - saving for the future
- Mother hen - very protective
- Flew the coop - gone
- Walking on eggshells- treading softly where certain people are concerned; trying not to upset someone
- Like a chicken with it's head cut off - running around with no direction
- You're chicken! - being afraid
- Hard-boiled - tough attitude
- Ruffle your feathers - something annoys you
- No spring chicken - you're old. Plain and simple.
- Hatch an idea - put a plan into motion
- Pecking order - finding your place
- Brood over it - to worry; to hover over a problem
- Chicken scratch - poor handwriting
- Stick your neck out - go to bat for someone else
- Stuck in your craw - upset about something and won't verbalize what's going on inside you; carrying a grudge.
- Bad egg - less than honest person; poor moral standards
- In a stew - got yourself in trouble
- Raise your hackle feathers - visibly annoyed 
- Nesting behavior- preparing a home (especially pregnant women just before a baby is due)
- Empty nest syndrome - depression and loneliness when children leave home
- Made from scratch - made from raw materials by hand

Unwieldy,

Not great use of screen real estate

Other?

.title[Better option]
.right-column[
Can use metaphors to leverage existing conceptual models
- Not really an attempt to simulate a real desktop
- Leverages existing knowledge about files, folders, trash
- A way to explain why some windows seem blocked

- Where are the gulf of evaluation and gulf of execution in this
  image?  Gulf of execution is the user 'error' region (user requests
  function the __system DOESNT HAVE__), gulf of
  evaluation is when the user __doesn't realize the system HAS a
  functionality__. 
  
- How does undo help the user bridge them?

What mental model error is this likely to create?

teleconference” but to continue we have to hit the “Start Recording”
button. So we have a conflict in the mental model

Gulf of Evaluation

---

# Causes of Gulf of Evaluation
???
- Hard to understand visual feedback
- Poor use of colors
- Bad layout, poor grouping
- Unfamiliar display of information
- Unfamiliar design patterns, or doesn’t follow convention
- Forcing people to remember lots of things
- Lack of feedback in response to inputs
- Might not see visual updates
- Can’t find info on screen 
- Might look same as unimportant
- Irrelevant info on screen / important info missing
---
# Causes of Gulf of Execution
???
- Unfamiliar devices and inputs
- Don’t know what is possible
- Unfamiliar GUI components 
- Solvable with experience
- Unfamiliar interaction patterns
- Also solvable with experience
- Example patterns: Dialogs, Shopping Carts

.title[Feedback]
.body[
Response by the system to the actions of the user – Cause and effect

Essential for forming mental models

Makes “system state” visible

Messenger Feedback | and | Gmail Feedback

.title[Design Tip #2 Make the Conceptual Model Visible]
.right-column[
Explicitly design a conceptual model 

Use affordance and feedback
(and everything else you have) to reinforce it
]

---
.title[Feed Forward]
.right-column[
What will happen if you execute action
- Ex. Web page mouseover
- Ex. Word processing I-bar
- Ex. Label on a button

Help people predict what will happen
- Need feedforward at all scales
- GUI widgets will handle basic feedforward
- Don’t forget feedforward for screens
