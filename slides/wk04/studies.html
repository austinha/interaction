-“Computer” inherently buggy
-Can’t get accurate time measurement
-Hard to implement some functionality: pulldowns, feedback, drag, viz …
-Won’t look like final product: sometimes hard to recognize components
-End-users can’t use by themselves: not in context of user’s work environment
-Couldn’t measure realistic I/O
-Lack of interactive feedback: e.g. button highlights
-“Computer” has to keep track of a lot of paper
-Users wouldn’t criticize UI
-Doesn’t map well to what will actual fit on the screen 
-Couldn’t hold in your hand – different ergonomics from target device
-Some things could not be simulated (highlighting)
-Writing on paper not the same as writing on target device / Hard to draw well (-recognition of elements)
-Appearance unrealistic
-Dynamic components hard to simulate (pop-ups)
-Couldn’t give proper affordance that something wasn’t selectable
-Some items had to be static!
-Dragging hard to simulate

.left-column[## High Fi testing]
.right-column[
Must test & observe ideas with customers

 - Want to compare and contrast
 - Want to get more realistic reactions

Paper mock-ups don’t go far enough
 - How would you show a drag operation?
 - Not realistic of how interface will be used

Approaches
 - Can fake it -- good for early
 - Can implement it

Choose your focus

Task design:
- Appropriate scope
- Predictable outcomes
- Elicits action

Video, Descriptions of behaviors, Notes
Can transcribe and analyze individual users
Can look for patterns across users

What went well?
What went badly?
What matters (severe, common)?

.left-column[##Qualitative data collection]
.right-column[
Identify Critical Incidents (can be good or bad)

Critical Incidents are Situations that: 
- Provoke silence 
- Provoke puzzlement 
- Provoke user comments 

Capture using Critical Incident reports

.left-column[#Critical Incident Report]
.right-column[
Name: System doesn’t treat “1” and “one” interchangeably
Severity:   High/Medium/Low + Good/Bad
Frequency:  (expected within system)
Category: 
The user accomplishes a goal, but in a suboptimal way OR
The user expresses some negative affect or says something is a problem.
Evidence: Report FACTS!
What the user (s) said: “My destination is One Market Street” “This is not right, I don't think this is what I want to do.” (on “Multiple Search Results” page).

What the user (s) did: After receiving the “no exact match” error message, the user hits the Back button to return to the trip planner and enters “1” instead of “One.”

What the system did: The system presented the user with a “Multiple Search Results” page, with the error message “We found some locations similar to your destination entry, but no exact match.”  After the user returns to the trip planner and enters “1,” the system returns a bus route.
