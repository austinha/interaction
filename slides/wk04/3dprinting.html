# Response to feedback
Evening office hours
 - Thursday evening office hours (5:30-7:30) INSTEAD of Wed 1-2
 - Tuesday evening office hours (5-6) INSTEAD of Tuesday 12-1
 
SPECS: Trying to point you at more documentation; Update spec when new
info of consequence on Piazza

Will try to add expected time. 

Calibration is an issue for all of us. We need to know about long
assignments so we can fix the confusing stuff!

???
Note: this is somewhat higher than we expected
But the bigger concern is spread

.title[What do new fabrication technologies provide?]
.body[
New ways to create
- Faster, easier, sometimes better

New ways to customize
- Faster iteration
- Mass customization

New materials

New shapes
]
---
.title[What new fabrication technologies are not]
.body[

Not the startrek replicator

Not as fast as the best manufacturing solutions for bulk manufacturing

Not as fast as your 2d printer

Often expensive

Material range is limited

We will use OpenSCAD in this class. I also highly recommend

.title[Making a printable model]

Avoid overhangs greater than (about) 45 degrees

![:img Picture of a simple model with a 45 and 90 degree overhang
illustrating what is not printable, 80%](img/3dprinting/overhang.png)

]
???
Why is 45° OK?

That is the theoretical tipping point
If you have square blocks sitting on each other that’s the point at which the center of gravity of the block on top goes over the edge of the block below
--
.body[
Thoughts on how to avoid overhang?
]

???
design

support (we can add this later)

Orientation 

---
.title[Making a printable model]
.body[
Avoid overhangs greater than (about) 45 degrees

Avoid bridges longer than (printer dependent)
- Speed can change max distance/success (why?)
- Can add a thin membrane (such as tape, or even 1 layer of filament) by halting
  print to further improve bridging & solve overhang problems)

| Bridge | Example Use| Bolt |
|--|--|
| ![:img Picture of a simple model with a bridge, 70%](img/3dprinting/bridge.png) | ![:img Picture of a bridge being used to help with an overhang, 50%](img/3dprinting/bridge-overhang.png) | ![:img Picture of a nut and bolt inserted in a print,50%](img/3dprinting/nutbolt.png)

]
???
Speed reduces droop

cooling further reduces droop (shrinkage)

What is the second example good for? nut and bolt! 


---
.title[Finishing your model]
.body[
May need to repair problems

May need to add support 

May need to add other materials (e.g. conductive filament

Recommendation: Use [**Meshmixer**](http://www.123dapp.com/meshmixer) for this

[How big is that cavity?](http://www.fairburyfastener.com/xdim_page.htm)


]

???

Typical geometry:
- Hexagonal cavity for nut
- Cylindrical hole for bolt to pass through
- Layers printed over the top of that

---
.title[Printing issues with Embedding]
.body[
Can't place objects before the print head gets to a layer

May not be able to print objects that are covered up

Depending on design, need to pause the print at just the right point

Can edit g-code to do this (add ```@pause```)
]

???
Could just watch very carefully and hit “Pause” in Repetier-Host at just the right spot

- bearings  (e.g. fidget spinners)

 By clicking the “start” button (b) the application runs and several
  tabs can be selected (c). The “Procedure” box (d) provide to the
  user the instructions to perform the assay, then the Begin button
  allow to proceed to the “Checklist” box (e) where preset timers
  guide the user through the correct incubation times before BL image
  acquisition. The instructions can be also eluded by selecting “Test
  sample” in the home page, which jumps the user directly to the
  checklist. At the end of the countdown the smartphone camera is
  activated and the user can simply touch the “Acquire” button to
  capture the BL image of both the test and control wells. (f) The
  acquired images are rapidly analyzed on the smartphone and the
  sample toxicity result is displayed as “Cell viability” value and a
  warning message (Safe, Harmful, Highly toxic). BL image and results
  can be also saved for downstream application (i.e. sending results
  to a central laboratory).
