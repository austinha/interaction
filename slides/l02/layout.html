# Goals for today
- Peer grade Doodle exercise 
- Layouts in Android
  - Examples
  - How do you create layouts?
- ConstraintLayout in Android 
- Code along a simple ConstraintLayout
---
layout: false

# Peer Grading
- Why?
  - Chance to externalize your work

- What to expect  

  - Your grade won't be determined by peer grading alone

  - Questions about spec requirements -- no room for interpretation

  - Questions that prompt about subjective feedback
    - Provide constructive feedback

  - Anonymous to your peers (but not to the teaching staff)

- Your feedback on the exercise! (be honest)

layout: false
# Peer Grading Instructions
- You should have been assigned to peer grade __ assignments
- If you have an Android phone
  - Click on the download link to install the app on your phone
- If you don't have a phone
  - Download the APK files
  - Open the APK file in Android Sudio and run the app in the emulator
- Fill out the google form for each APK file

# User Interfaces on Android

- Views
  - Base class for __all__ UI elements
  - Controls (switches, sliders, etc)
  - UI Components - typical display elements mentioned in SSUI lecture (e.g buttons, labels, image views, etc)
- ViewGroups
  - Encapsulates one or more views (e.g. Android Components, Layouts)
  - Can define specific **layout** properties
- Layout
  - Defines the structure for the user interface (UI) of your app
  - View and ViewGroup objects live within Layouts

# Layout Types in Android

- [FrameLayout](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/component/FrameLayout.html) - good for position views on
top of each other, or encapsulating a bunch of views

- [__LinearLayout__](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/component/LinearLayout.html) - places views one after
the other in order according to the orientation (Horizontal or Vertical)

- [__TableLayout__](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/component/TableLayout.html) - Rows and columns style
way of declaring a layout 

- [GridLayout](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/component/GridLayout.html) - Uses
an [*adapter*](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/interactor/Adapter.html) that provides items to display in
a grid

- [ListView](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/layout/listview.html) - Uses an [*adapter*](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/component/Adapter.html)
class that provides items to display in a list

- [__RelativeLayout__](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/component/RelativeLayout.html) - positions views with
respect to on another

- [WebView](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/webkit/WebView.html) - uses html/css to layout a page, but requires
`INTERNET` permission in your manifest

# Layouts in Play

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-evenly">
  <ul style="margin: 3%">
    <li>FrameLayout</li>
    <li>TableLayout</li>
    <li>LinearLayout</li>
    <li>GridLayout</li>
    <li>ListView</li>
    <li>RelativeLayout</li>
  </ul>
  <div style="margin: 3%">
    <img src="img/pinterest-android.png" style="width: 100%; height: 100%;"/>
  </div>

  <div style="margin: 3%">
    <img src="img/android-linear.png"/>
  </div>
</div>

# Declaring Layouts

- Declare UI elements in XML: Android provides XML vocabulary that corresponds to specific views / layouts
  - Alternatively, you could also use Android's Layout Editor tool

- Instantiate layout elements at run time

- Programmatic v. XML
    - Depends on the developer
    - Starting with XML is considered to be better style
---
layout: false

## ConstraintLayout in Android

- ConstraintLayout is a ViewGroup that allows you to position widgets in a flexible way
  - Useful for building **responsive** interfaces in Android.

- Will be using ConstraintLayout for the Layout exercise

- Short exercise using ConstraintLayout for the remaining time.

# How Android Draws Views (1/2)
]
.right-column[
When an `Activity` receives focus, Android requests the activity draw its layout
]
--
.right-column[
An activity __must__ provide a root node of the layout hierarchy
]
--
.right-column[
The root node will measure and draw the layout tree
]
---
.left-column[
# How Android Draws Views (2/2)
]
.right-column[
__In-order tree traversal__ is done on the layout hierarchy..
]

--
.right-column[
Each view is responsible for drawing itself before (i.e. __behind__) their children
]
--
.right-column[
Siblings are drawn in the order that they appear

# When to (re)Draw?
]
.right-column[
Drawing is costly- (e.g. frame rates dropping for scrolling interactions)
]
--
.right-column[
Often the screen is static
]
--
.right-column[
We should *draw when we need to*
]

--
.right-column[
Re-drawing "damaged" areas: call `invalidate()`

.left-column[
# The Drawing Process
]
.right-column[
1) Android calls measure on root node (view)
```java
// View specifies size of self
protected void onMeasure(int widthMeasureSpec, int heightMeasureSpec);
```
]
--
.right-column[
2) Android calls layout on view
```java
// View specifies size and position of children
protected void onLayout(boolean changed, int left, int top, int right, int bottom);
```
]
--
.right-column[
3) Android calls draw on view
```java
// Add the drawing happens
protected void onDraw(Canvas canvas);
```
]
---
.left-column[
# Measuring
]
.right-column[
`onMeasure()` is a callback invoked by `View.measure()`
]
--
.right-column[
Guidance about the size is given from parent view in the form of `MeasureSpec` parameters
]
--
.right-column[
Ensures every view has a width and height value set prior to a layout pass
]
--
.footnote[
Note: You must manually take padding into account (subtract padding
from the width/height dimensions)
]
---
.left-column[
# Layout
]
.right-column[
`onLayout()` is a callback triggered when a view's position is changed
]
--
.right-column[
Gives the new position __relative__ to the parent
]
--
.right-column[
Causes a layout call on all children (!)
]
