layout: false

# Goals for today
- Peer grade Doodle exercise 
- Layouts in Android
  - Examples
  - How do you create layouts?
- ConstraintLayout in Android 
- Code along a simple ConstraintLayout
---
layout: false

# Peer Grading
- Chance to externalize your work
- You should have been assigned to peer grade __ assignments
- Instructions
  - Download the APK files
  - Open the APK file in Android Sudio
  - Fill out this google form: https://bit.ly/2KfaMD0 (for each APK file)
- Also fill out your feedback on the exercise

# User Interfaces on Android

- Views
  - Base class for __all__ UI elements

--
  - Controls (switches, sliders, etc)

--
  - UI Components - typical display elements mentioned in SSUI lecture (e.g buttons, labels, image views, etc)

--

- ViewGroups
  - Encapsulates one or more views (e.g. Android Components, Layouts)

--

  - *Note*: Android Components are self-contained, home-screen-specific display items for apps (e.g. clock/time, weather, email-at-a-glance)
--

- Layout
  - Defines the structure for the user interface (UI) of your app
  - View and ViewGroup objects live within Layouts

---

# Layout Types in Android

- [FrameLayout](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/component/FrameLayout.html) - good for position views on
top of each other, or encapsulating a bunch of views

- [__LinearLayout__](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/component/LinearLayout.html) - places views one after
the other in order according to the orientation (Horizontal or Vertical)

- [__TableLayout__](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/component/TableLayout.html) - Rows and columns style
way of declaring a layout 

- [GridLayout](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/component/GridLayout.html) - Uses
an [*adapter*](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/interactor/Adapter.html) that provides items to display in
a grid

- [ListView](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/layout/listview.html) - Uses an [*adapter*](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/component/Adapter.html)
class that provides items to display in a list

- [__RelativeLayout__](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/component/RelativeLayout.html) - positions views with
respect to on another

- [WebView](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/webkit/WebView.html) - uses html/css to layout a page, but requires
`INTERNET` permission in your manifest

# Layouts in Play

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-evenly">
  <div style="margin: 3%">
    <img src="img/pinterest-android.png" style="width: 80%; height: 90%;"/>
  </div>

  <div style="margin: 3%">
    <img src="img/android-linear.png"/>
  </div>
</div>

# Declaring Layouts

- Declare UI elements in XML: Android provides XML vocabulary that corresponds to specific views / layouts

- Instantiate layout elements at run time

- Programmatic v. XML
    - Depends on the developer
    - Starting with XML is considered to be better style

## ConstraintLayout in Android

.left-column[
# How Android Draws Views (1/2)
]
.right-column[
When an `Activity` receives focus, Android requests the activity draw its layout
]
--
.right-column[
An activity __must__ provide a root node of the layout hierarchy
]
--
.right-column[
The root node will measure and draw the layout tree
]
---
.left-column[
# How Android Draws Views (2/2)
]
.right-column[
__In-order tree traversal__ is done on the layout hierarchy..
]

--
.right-column[
Each view is responsible for drawing itself before (i.e. __behind__) their children
]
--
.right-column[
Siblings are drawn in the order that they appear  

.center.half-width-img[

  ]
]
---
.left-column[
# When to (re)Draw?
]
.right-column[
Drawing is costly- (e.g. frame rates dropping for scrolling interactions)
]
--
.right-column[
Often the screen is static
]
--
.right-column[
We should *draw when we need to*
]

--
.right-column[
Re-drawing "damaged" areas: call `invalidate()`
]
---
.left-column[
# The Drawing Process
]
.right-column[
1) Android calls measure on root node (view)
```java
// View specifies size of self
protected void onMeasure(int widthMeasureSpec, int heightMeasureSpec);
```
]
--
.right-column[
2) Android calls layout on view
```java
// View specifies size and position of children
protected void onLayout(boolean changed, int left, int top, int right, int bottom);
```
]
--
.right-column[
3) Android calls draw on view
```java
// Add the drawing happens
protected void onDraw(Canvas canvas);
```
]
---
.left-column[
# Measuring
]
.right-column[
`onMeasure()` is a callback invoked by `View.measure()`
]
--
.right-column[
Guidance about the size is given from parent view in the form of `MeasureSpec` parameters
]
--
.right-column[
Ensures every view has a width and height value set prior to a layout pass
]
--
.footnote[
Note: You must manually take padding into account (subtract padding
from the width/height dimensions)
]
---
.left-column[
# Layout
]
.right-column[
`onLayout()` is a callback triggered when a view's position is changed
]
--
.right-column[
Gives the new position __relative__ to the parent
]
--
.right-column[
Causes a layout call on all children (!)
]
