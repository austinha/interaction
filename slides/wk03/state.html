[//]: # (Outline Slide)
# Today's goals

layout: false

# Exercise: Build your own color picker
Learning goals: 
- Create non-rectangle interactor
- Use a state machine to manage feedback
- Event handlers and event bubbling
- CallbacksReact to events
- Should handle error cases appropriately

Android learning goals:
- Save app state
- Handle touch input properly
- Understand app lifecycle

# Example: Specify the end points for a line
]
.right-column[
Could just specify two endpoints – click, click
- not good: no affordance, <br>no feedback (/ feedforward)

Better feedback is to use “rubber banding”
- stretch out the line as you drag
- at all times, shows where you would end up <br> if you “let go”

Importance of feedback vs application callback

Accept the press for endpoint P1; P2 = P1;

Discuss! 
Not event based
Not in the basic event/redraw loop
Potentially locks up the system

  Means: When you are in Start State, and a Mouse Down event arrives, do
  the action ```Start_line()``` and go to Drawing State. Then update
  the line end point position every time the mouse moves. Finally,
  when it releases (Mouse Release event), finish the line (at this
  stage a callback to the application might be appropriate)

- translates input sequence into action!
- How could we provide a better affordance?
- Does it matter if we are using a mouse or a touch screen?

What constitutes an “event” varies

- may be just low level events, or
- higher level (synthesized) events
- e.g. region-enter, press-inside

What is missing? Query fields

#When to use PPSs

- You're probably already using them, just not intentionally (and maybe
less well as a result)
- PPSs are a good way to do control flow in event driven systems

Can do (formal or informal) analysis
- are all possible inputs (e.g. errors) handled from each state
- what are next legal inputs: can use to enable / disable
Can be automated based on higher level specification

---
# Implementation of PPS

???
fsm_transition(state, evt) switch (state)

..case 0: // case for each state

...switch(evt.kind)

...case loc_move: // transition event

....do all the transition actions
....state = 42 // set the new state

..case 1: // case for next state switch (evt.kind) ...

return state;

Replicate the larger one

Once for every state in the smaller one!

At transitions between corresponding states

Correct semantics
  - Eliminate impossible states
  - Merge similar ones


Now add another independent machine (shift key?)

]
???
Totally out of hand -- combinatorical explosion!

---

.left-column[##Summary]
.right-column[
State machines are very good (for this job) but do have limits

State machines don't handle independent actions very well (state explosion)

Mostly useful for smaller things

- Great for individual components
- Not so great for whole dialogs

Path of least resistance is rigid sequencing
 Ask: is this good for what I am doing?

.left-column[## Guards on transitions]
.right-column[
Sometimes also use “guards”

- predicate (Boolean expr) before event

- adds extra conditions required to fire

- typical notation: pred : event / action

- e.g. button.enabled: press-inside / A

Note: FSM augmented with guards is Turing complete

## Another example: Pull-down Menu

How do we manage the drop-down behavior?

FSM controller?

Behavior:

- Body pulls down on press (in arrow)

- Body stays down until release

- Items highlighted while cursor is over them
