This is just a line

Fitts’ law tells us about difficulty for pointing and selection tasks
- Time to move the hand depends only on relative precision required
- MT increases as __distance__ from target increases
- MT decreases as __size__ of target increases

What else might we want to measure?

- Time on Task -- How long does it take people to
complete basic tasks? (For example, find something to
buy, create a new account, and order the item.)
- Accuracy -- How many mistakes did people make? (And
were they fatal or recoverable with the right information?)
- How strenuous (e.g. gaze has lower throughput but is less strenuous
than head pointing Mackenzie 2018)
...
- Recall -- How much does the person remember
afterwards or after periods of non-use?
- Emotional Response -- How does the person feel about
the tasks completed? (Confident? Stressed? Would the
user recommend this system to a friend?) 

Build up a list of good UI design principals from these basics
- Undo
- Predictability
- ...
