[//]: # (Outline Slide)
# Today's goals
- Case study of Menu Design
- Discussion of key aspects of Component Design
- Understand some key properties of people

layout: false

.left-column[##Mini Case Study: Menus]
.right-column[
Menu

- supports selection of an item from a fixed set – usually set determined in advance

- typically used for “commands”

- occasionally for sezng value (e.g., picking a font)
]

---
.left-column[##Design alternatives for menus]
.right-column[
Simple, fixed location menus –  (see these on the web a lot)

- easy to implement

- good affordances

 - easy for novices (always same place, fully visible)

- Focus of attention problems

- Screen space hog
]
---
.left-column[##Popup menus]
.right-column[

Menu pops up under the cursor (sometimes via “other button”)

- close to cursor
]
--
.right-column[
  not under it, why?
]
--
.right-column[
- takes no screen space (until used)
- can be context dependent (!)
- poor (non-existent) affordance
]
---
.left-column[##Getting best of both: Mac pulldown menus]
.right-column[
Menu bar fixed at top of screen, with pull-down submenus

- benefits of fixed location

- provides good affordance

- good use of space via partial popup

- but splits aoention & requires long moves
]

]
---
.left-column[##Other menus]
.right-column[
Why don’t we see these much? Just not known

Harder to implement

 - Particularly drawing labels

 - But there are variations that are easier

Doesn’t scale past a few items

 - No hierarchy (or at least harder)
]
---
layout: true

.left-column[##Let's talk about design principals for components]
.right-column[
- Affordances

- Feedback

- Performance Properties of People (why is this about component design?)
]
---
layout: false

.left-column[##Affordance]
.right-column[
Opportunities to act
which are readily apparent to the user ... and appropriate to the
user’s abilities 

Form “affords” certain actions and makes that apparent

Allows and promotes certain actions

- Door knobs afford turning

-   Handle of hammer affords grasping in a par2cular way
]
---
.left-column[##Affordance Example: Knurling]
.right-column[
– Small ridges typically found on knobs

Increases friction

Affords grip

xx needs image
]
---
.left-column[##“Virtual affordances”]
.right-column[
Don’t typically have much physical form in a GUI

But, visual appearance can still suggest function

xx needs image of knurling in UI
--
Note that you don’t have to know about knurling for this to afford
“grip” with the mouse
]
---
.left-column[##Feedback]
.right-column[
Response by the system to the actins of the user – Cause and effect

- Essential for forming mental models

Making “system state” visible
]
---
.left-column[##Component design guideline #1]
.right-column[
Explicitly design a conceptual model and use affordance and feedback
(and everything else you have)
to reinforce it
]
---
.left-column[##Performance properties of people]
.right-column[

(Only a very few here) How long will things take?

- e.g., physical movements

How much can people remember? How fast are thing perceived?
]
---
.left-column[##How long will user actions take]
.right-column[

Strong models for physical movement

Fitts’ law predicts movements as a function of distance and required accuracy:

T = A log2(D/S + 0.5) + B D – distance to target

S – size of target

A,B proportionality constant and intercept (linear fit)

– Property of user (motor control group)
]
---
---
.left-column[##Speed Differences Explained]
.right-column[

Menu position and design can have a
significant impact on speed of interaction

Fitts' law is the main
explanation for this.
]
---
.left-column[##Fitts law –
helps to capture the difficulty of input with different devices]
.right-column[
Time = A + B*log2(Dist/Size + 0.5)

“Index of Difficulty”

- Time is linearly proportional to “index of difficulty” (log of what we would intuitively think of as “difficulty”)

  - Proportionality constants depend on muscle group and device

  - Difficulty determined by distance and required accuracy (size of
target)
]
---
.left-column[##Fitts’ law]
.right-column[

Actual numbers from Fitts’ law generally not all that helpful

- That level of detailed analysis is hard

- Very hard to know what exact distances are across

dynamic layout and varied platforms General guideline

- Keep required movements (accuracy & distance) firmly in mind
 - Avoid device swapping
 - Avoid disturbing focus of attention
]
---
.left-column[##Fitts’ law]
.right-column[
(True) expert performance tends to be closely related to time required for movements

- not that closely related to learning (or performance) of novices

- still need to consider “cognitive load”
]
---
.left-column[##How much can a person remember Short term (working)
memory]
.right-column[
- Famous 7 +/- 2 “chunks” (Somewhat outdated model)

- For us just: “very limited” and “decays quickly” – Has become “worse” with constant multitasking

Long term

– Essentially unbounded
– But requires effort & may not always work on cue –  Can’t explicitly forget! Even though you try!
]
---
.left-column[##How much can a person remember Novice / expert
differences]
.right-column[
-  Experts have learned items in long term memory to draw on, novices don’t

-  But note that having the ability to operate from recogni2on does not preclude recall

Implication:

- Generally better to rely on recognition (seeing it in front of you)
than just recall (having to pull it out of long term memory)
]
---
.left-column[##How fast are things perceived?]
.right-column[

less than ~20ms (1/50 sec) discrete images/flashes merge into con2nuous percep2on

- Image you are looking at flickers 60 times per second
- Differences in peripheral vision
  - Sabertooth tigers
]
--
.right-column[
Don’t ever have to be faster than this for user response!

Get more than 120 million instructions per core (@3Ghz)

(High end GPU theoretically as high as 26 billion instr.)
 - You can do a lot with that
 -  (First GUIs had ~20K)
 -  Not enough? Twice as many cores in 2-3yrs...
]
---
.left-column[##How fast are things perceived?]
.right-column[
 ~100ms seems like “instant response”

- Hard to tell response times below this apart

- Upper range of eye saccades

Discrete images into steps instead of apparent motion
]
---
.left-column[##How fast are things perceived?]
.right-column[

100ms (1/10 sec)

Except some animation, most things don’t need to be faster than this

- Typical target “cycle time”

- 600 million+ machine instructions, ...
]
---
.left-column[##How fast are things perceived?]
.right-column[
 1-2 seconds typically “good response time”

-  Similar times in conversa2onal turn taking protocols

-  Longer delays ~5 sec have to say something to keep conversation alive

(Note: numbers fuzzier as we go out)
]
---
.left-column[##How fast are things perceived?]
.right-column[
10-15 sec is typically “bad response time” – STM decay effects
]
---
.left-column[##A liMle about response times]
.right-column[
Good vs. bad response time
is very dependent on expecta2on

-  If you can’t meet the goals, manipulate user expectations!

Consistency of response is very important

- Can be more important than
time
]
---
.left-column[##How long do other cognitive activities take?]
.right-column[
Unfortunate, but...

–  Things known, but overall not as well understood –  Much harder to apply what is understood

–  See other HCI courses for some of this
]
---
.left-column[##We do know essen2ally minimums]
.right-column[
“Cycle” times for “Human Processor”
(Model Human Processor [Card, Moran, Newell])

- Perceptual ~100ms [50-200]

- Cognitive ~70ms [25-170]

- Motor ~70ms [30-100]

Can be used to predict reaction times and highly routine actions

- E.g., it takes at least ~150ms to
act on something (~250ms more likely)

Harder to use for complex things and/or with learning

XX add some active learning?
XX add something about color perception here or earlier?
