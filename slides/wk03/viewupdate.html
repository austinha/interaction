.title[Getting Help]
.body[
Before asking for help (even on Piazza), there are some key things you need to do: 

1. Read the spec code through 
2. Specify the error that is occuring including the text of the error
3. Explain what you have done to isolate and debug
4. If it has to do with things not showing up visually, have already
used the live inspector; and include a screen shot; and have tried
printouts (logs)
5. If it has to do with the app crashing, include the (relevant) error
 message and at least one thing you've logged to try to debug the
 error
]

.title[Getting Help]
.body[
Office hours (virtual or in person) can be requested any time, but
24 hours warning will be needed to schedule. We will post a link on
Piazza when these are scheduled.

Captain obvious is a really helpful thing. You can do this for each
other. 

If you don't know anyone in the class, email us, and we will
assign ‘buddies’ who can play ‘captain obvious’ to each other 

Piazza monitoring times will be made more explicit

Other suggestions from the class?

    // Start by implementing the interface
    public class ExampleActivity extends AppCompatActivity
      implements View.OnClickListener { // Necessary to implement

      private Button mButton;
      private int mButtonClicks = 0;

## Registering a Listener (1/2)

- Once a listener is created
- Set it on the view:
]
.right-column[
  ```java
    Button mButton = (Button) findViewById(R.id.button_test);
    if (mButton != null) {
      mButton.setOnClickListener(buttonListener);
    }
  ```
]
---
.left-column[
## Registering a Listener (2/2)
]
.right-column[
- `View` has a series of `set*Listeners(...)`, for example:

```java
  View v = new View();
  v.setOnClickListener(...);
  v.setLongClickListener(...);
  ```
]
---
.left-column[
## Marking an event as handled
]
.right-column[
- Many listeners return a `boolean` value that indicate the event has been handled
- Returning `false` causes the event to bubble up to the next possible view that can handle it

  ```java
    /**
     * onLongClick - triggered when a view is long clicked
     * @param v - the view long pressed
     * @return - true if the callback consumed the long click, false otherwise.
     **/
    boolean onLongClick (View v) { ... };
  ```

.left-column[
## Review: How Android Triggers Listeners]

.right-column[
- Android traverses the view hierarchy (starting at root)
- "Picks" `Views` that respond to an input event
- Loops through the list of `View` objects, checks if they will "capture" the event
- If none capture the event, the event "bubbles" back up the `View`
  object list

## Saving Activity State (1/3)]
.right-column[
- Android provides the `onSaveInstanceState(Bundle savedInstanceState)` callback method for you to save the state of an `Activity`

```java
private static final USERNAME_KEY = "USER_NAME_KEY";
private static final FIB_SUM_KEY = "FIB_SUM_KEY";

private int mFibSumValue; // Set to 10295 by our user
private String mUsername; // Set to "Prabha" by our user

@Override
public void onSaveInstanceState(Bundle outState) {
    // Always call super - your super classes could be saving state for you!
    super.onSaveInstanceState(outState);

    // Now
    outState.putInt(FIB_SUM_KEY, mFibSumValue);
    outState.putString(USERNAME_KEY, mUsername);
}
```

## Restoring in `onCreate` vs. `onRestoreInstanceState`
]
.right-column[
- `onRestoreInstanceState`
  - Guarantees you will never have a non-null `Bundle` when called
  - Lets subclasses override the behavior of restoring the state

- `onCreate`
  - Lets you focus on doing all of your initialization in one place

- In the assignment we use onCreate

# Basics of Event Listeners (1/3)

- Interface on the `View` class that acts as a _callback_ method

--

- Must be attached to a particular `View`

--

- Android framework triggers the method once the `View` is interacted with by the user

--

- A `View` can have listen for different types of interactions
- But: the `View` must implement and registering the appropriate listeners

---
.left-column[
## Many Views, Same Listener (1/3)]

.right-column[
- Event callbacks are passed the `View` as a parameter
]
--

- We can reuse a listener for views that handle the same action
  (e.g. 3 buttons increment the same click count)

---

## Many Views, Same Listener (2/3)

- And we can handle different actions by checking the `View` or its `id`:
  ```java
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedState) {
      Button mButtonOne = (Button) findViewById(R.id.button_one);
      if (mButtonOne != null) {
        mButtonOne.setOnClickListener(mButtonClickListener);
      }

      Button mButtonTwo = (Button) findViewById(R.id.button_two);
      if (mButtonTwo != null) {
        mButton.setOnClickListener(mButtonClickListener);
      }
    }
  ```
---
## Many Views, Same Listener (3/3)

```java
  View.OnClickListener mButtonClickListener = new View.OnClickListener({
    public void OnClick(View v) {
      if (v == null) {
        return;
      }

      int viewId = v.getId();

      switch (viewId) {
        case R.id.button_one:
          // First Button
          Log.d("Button Press", "First Button");
          break;
        case R.id.button_two:
          // Second Button
          Log.d("Button Press", "Second Button");
          break;
        default:
          // Someone else is using the listener!
          Log.d("Button Press", "Invalid Button!");

      }
    }
  });
```
---
.left-column[
## More on Listeners]
.right-column[

- Different views can have different handlers
    - `ListView`: `onItemClick`
    - Context menus from long clicks: `onCreateContextMenu`
    - Keystrokes: `onKey`
    - And others...
]

--

- Check documentation for specifics

---
# Saving state: advanced material
---

- Custom objects that implement the `Serializable` or `Parcelable` interfaces
  - You will need to make any custom classes that you want to save into a `Bundle` implement the `Parcelable` interface

---

# Parcelable vs. Serializable

- Both are for the same purpose of saving but `Serializable` makes implementations much easier...

--

- **EXCEPT, .red[you should almost always use `Parcelable`]**

--

- Why?
  - `Serializable` uses introspection ==> more memory, and CPU cycles
  - `Parcelable` **is optimized for mobile devices**

---
## Implementing `Parcelable` (1/3)

-- You are required to implement the following methods for the `Parcelable` interface:

```java
public class MyPersonModel implements Parcelable {
    private int mAge;

    // Required for the interface
    public int describeContents() {
        return 0;
    }

    // Required for the interface
    public void writeToParcel(Parcel out, int flags) {
        out.writeInt(mAge);
    }
    // Continued on next slide...
```

---

## Implementing `Parcelable` (2/3)

```java

    // Required for the interface
    // CREATOR is an object that can remark
    public static final Parcelable.Creator<MyPersonModel> CREATOR
            = new Parcelable.Creator<MyPersonModel>() {
        public MyPersonModel createFromParcel(Parcel in) {
            return new MyPersonModel(in);
        }

        public MyPersonModel[] newArray(int size) {
            return new MyPersonModel[size];
        }
    };

    // Required for the interface
    // Private constructor for Android to use with your CREATOR
    private MyPersonModel(Parcel in) {
        mAge = in.readInt();
    }
}
```
---

## Implementing `Parcelable` (3/3)
- **Note**: .red[the order of the values when writing and reading them matters!]

  - When you write to the parcel using `write*()` methods in `writeToParcel`,

  - The write order __MUST BE__ the same as when you read them in the private constructor

- For more details on implementation:
  https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Parcelable.html

protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
  super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
  setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);

  mMainTextView = (TextView) findViewById(R.id.text_main_title);
  mSumTextView = (TextView) findViewById(R.id.text_sum);
  // Check if there was a previously saved state to restore to the user
  // A non-null bundle means there was a state that was saved previously
  // A bundle is just a Key-Value pairing - its a hash map :)
  if (savedInstanceState != null) {
    // There was a previous state - time to restore
    mFibSumValue = savedInstanceState.getInt(FIB_SUM_KEY);
    mUsername = savedInstanceState.getString(USERNAME_KEY);
  }
  updateMainText();
  updateFibSumText();
}
```

    mFibSumValue = savedInstanceState.getInt(FIB_SUM_KEY);
    mUsername = savedInstanceState.getString(USERNAME_KEY);

## Exercise: Parcelable and Activity State

- Pair up!

- Download the base code here:

- This app lets a user enter a name, age, and favorite food

- It stores this info in a `PersonModel`

- When the app is killed, this information needs to remain edited

- Implement the `Parcelable` interface for the PersonModel

- Then use the Activity's relevant state change callbacks to `PersonModel` when the phone rotates

---
### Some Notes about `onSaveInstanceState()`
- .red[Only use to save and restore session variables and the state of the UI]

--

  - Android won't always trigger the method

--

  - It is called when the `Activity` is closed and _expected_ to be restored soon

--

- If your app crashes, or is closed, **the values in the bundle will disappear!**

--

- If you use custom views, you can implement their version of `onSaveInstanceState`:

  Android will call `onSaveInstanceState()` every view in the layout
