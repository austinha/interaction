- Introduce OpenSCAD
- Talk about elements of 3D modeling

[Beginner's
tutorial](http://edutechwiki.unige.ch/en/OpenScad_beginners_tutorial)

Comments and variables similar to what you are used to

```
//Name Tag - Customizable
Name = "Jen Mankoff";
Length = 90 ;
c = 20;
```

.title[OpenSCAD concepts: solids]
.body[
Primitive Solids such as `cube([2,3,4]);` make up your designs

Also `sphere` `cylinder` `polyhedron` 
]
---
.title[OpenSCAD concepts: transformations]
.body[
Same as 2D transformations

- `rotate([x,y,z]) [solid]`
- `translate([x,y,z]) [solid]`
- `mirror([x,y,z]) [solid]`
- ...
]

.title[OpenSCAD concepts: CSG modeling]
.body[
- Union: `union() { [transformations/solids/etc] }` combines children
- Difference: `difference() {}` subtracts everything from first child
- Hull: `hull() {}` combines all the children within a convex hull 

]

.title[OpenSCAD concepts: 2G geometry + linear extrusion]
.body[
- `linear_extrude (height=XX)` and then define a polygon to extrude,
  e.g., `polygon(points=[[0,0],[100,0],[0,100],[15,15],[65,15],[15,65]], paths=[[0,1,2],[3,4,5]]);`

makes what?

.title[Other things to extrude]
.body[

- Can import a DXF file and extrude, just put this after `linear_extrude`: `import (file = "file.dxf");`

- text: 

```
content = "Text rocks";
font = "Liberation Sans";

translate ([-30,0,0]) {
   linear_extrude(height = 3) {
       text(content, font = font, size = 10);
     }
 }
```
]

.title[Other features]
.body[
[Cheat sheet](http://www.openscad.org/cheatsheet/index.html)

- `%` shows something transparently so you can find out what would
  happen
- `$fn` sets resolution (can speed things up by making this low during design)
- Can create functions (`module name() {}` )
- Can use for loops 
- Can use [other peoples' libraries](https://github.com/mtu-most/most-scad-libraries)
]

.title[Let's try it]
.body[
- Open OpenSCAD
- Before you begin modeling, go to View>>Show Axes. This will make it
  easier to see where the parts of your model are being placed.
- Click and drag to change viewing angle
- Right click and drag to move origin

.title[sample program]
.body[

```
//Name Tag
Name = "Jen Mankoff";
Length = 90 ;
c = 20;

linear_extrude(height = 5)
translate([0, 5, 0])
text(Name);

difference(){
    hull(){
        cylinder(h=2,d=40);
        translate([Length,0,0])
        cylinder(h=2,d=40);
    }
    translate([Length,0,0])
    cylinder(h=2,d=14);

}
```
