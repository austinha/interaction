# Should I take this class?
Yes! Some of today’s interfaces are being used by a billion people at
a time. Almost everything we create is created for people to use, and
user interfaces are how people interact with anything else you do
(whether it is a new machine learning algorithm or a database
system). User interfaces are incredibly important, but they also
represent a different programming paradigm than you may have learned
before. This class will teach you
- How to write an event-driven program which reacts to user input and
displays output. If you’ve never done this before, the abstractions
you will learn are standard in almost any user interface toolkit. Even
if you have, too often, without attention to structure, interfaces
become impenetrable spaghetti code.  
- How to think about the design of novel interaction techniques. As
devices diversify, so too do the ways in which people interact, from
voice based interfaces to augmented reality. By understanding the
principles of interaction technique design you can do a better job of
making interactions that users will want, which improves both the user
experience and the business value of what you create. 
- How to avoid common gotchas in the implementation of user
interfaces. We will teach you the proper way to implement Undo, create
Accessible Interfaces. We will also touch on other necessities (no
modal dialogues; good use of color; inclusion of spport for help and
so on).  

Taking a class is a big commitment, and you will work hard in this
class. So we want to help you make sure this is the right class for
you. Below is some information about prerequisites and expectations.

# Prereqs and expectations
The only requirement for this class is that you have taken CS 142 and
143 or an equivalent class, meaning you are comfortable programming in
Java, and have some experience with data structures. However, if you
are not comfortable working in an IDE environment, using version
control, and picking up and working with someone else’s library code,
you will likely need to plan for extra time with TAs, and possibly
attend extra tutoring sessions, to keep up with the class.  

The specific platform and language for this class are Java on Android
phones (or simulators); using the IntelliJ IDE (Android Studio). While
Google is switching over to Kotlin, there are good reasons to [start
learning Android with Java first](https://dzone.com/articles/java-vs-kotlin-which-language-android-developer-sh). 

Note that this class is designed for CS majors, and other students who
work regularly with information technology and are strong
programmers. While we will consider applications from outside the
major, in its first year, financial and room restrictions may limit
space for such students.

# Other relevant classes to know about
There are a number of classes on campus that teach related concepts
which you may wish to consider in addition to this one. As of summer,
2018, here are the ones we are aware of:

- [HCID 520: User Interface Software +
Technology](http://faculty.washington.edu/ajko/hcid520/) This course
teaches about user interfaces, including what they are, how they are
built, and some inventions in user interface software and
technology. Somem readings in this class may be from HCID 520. However
it differs from CSE 372 in that it is theoretical, not implementation
based. 
- [HCDE 310: Interactive Systems Design &
Technology](https://www.smunson.com/teaching/hcde310/a13/) This course is a
project based course that teaches how to prototype applications on the
web using Python that solve human problems or enable new
activities. Includes information about APIs how people interact. It
differs from CSE 372 in its choice of platform. Additionally, it
doesn’t cover the theory of UI programming, nor issues such as
accessibility, undo, and so on.   
- [INFO 343: Client side web
development](https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1118282) This is a
programming course, and there will be significant overlap between the
courses, as INFO 343 also touches on event based programming, output,
and accessibility. [CSE 154: Web
Programming](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse154/18sp/)
also covers some related 
material. However, both are about programming on the web using
Javascript instead of on Android, using Java. In addition, CSE 372
covers more of the theory of UI programming and design, similar to
HCID 520.  
- [HCDE 451: Prototyping](https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1052079/assignments/syllabus)
This class is for the [MHCI+D students](https://mhcid.washington.edu/)
only and focuses on prototyping techniques, not implementation. It
covers everything from paper prototyping to physical interfaces to 3D
printing.  
- [CSE 440: Introduction to
HCI](http://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse440/);  [441: Advanced HCI](http://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse441/) This is an advanced series of courses for undergraduate
seniors. The focus of 440 is less on programming and more broadly on
methods for designing, prototyping, and evaluating user interfaces to
computing applications, while 441 is an open ended capstone
course. These are excellent follow on courses to 372, for a student
who wants to go deeper into how to make usable, enjoyable effective
interfaces, and how to solve interesting problems with HCI. Related is
[CSE 510](http://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/csep510/), the HCI
course for the professional masters program.

# Course Structure
The most important goals in this class center around learning by
doing. This means that hands on time trying out everything from
implementation to interviewing is critical to learning. To help
facilitate this, this class is mostly ‘flipped’ meaning that all of
the information you need for this course will be provided in the form
of assigned readings, rather than lectures (for the most part). In
person meetings will be used for review and discussion, as well as
collaborative work assignments that help you make progress toward your
assigned homework. In other words, instead of getting information in
lecture and doing assignments at home, you'll get information at home
and (partially) do assignments in lecture. 

This structure will you allow you to work at a pace that is
comfortable for you individually, rather than requiring lectures to
fit a diverse range of backgrounds. It also means you'll easily be
able to get more direct support when learning and practicing the
material: whether from us or from other students in the class. 

However, this structure does require you to take more responsibility
for your own learning: it is up to you to read the course materials
before each class meeting, and to be willing to ask questions and seek
help if there are any problems. We will serve as mediators and support
for your learning, but your participation in and outside of class is
essential. You are accountable for your own learning—but we are here
to help! 

# Workload 
This is a challenging, four credit class, meaning you should expect 8
hours of homework a week. We hope make the workload as predictable as
possible. You can expect your weeks to look look something like this: 
- **Monday:** 	Come to class ready for discussion and activity
- **Tuesday:**     	Do your Wednesday reading [10 minutes]
- **Wednesday:** 	Come to class ready for discussion and activity; 
		Finish your homework by class today [6-7 hours]
- **Thursday:**    	Come to lab ready to work on your homework; 
	          	do your Friday reading [10 minutes]
- **Friday:** 	Come to class ready for discussion and activity
- **Weekend:** 	Do your Monday reading [10 minutes], then do your homework. 
		Stay on top of reading so you have time to focus on homework.

# Class Coordination
We want you to succeed in this class, and an important way that you do
that is by asking questions and discussing course issues with your
peers and teaching staff. Some ways to do that include: 
- We have a class discussion board on Piazza [link], where you can
make public posts that benefit the whole class, and are answered more
quickly because your fellow students can help the course staff by
responding also. This is the best way to ask questions about things
like homework. Before posting, please search through the questions
that have already been posted in case someone has already asked the
same question. 
- We hold office hours (see [link]). If none of those times work for
you. You can also discuss matters with us privately on Piazza
[link]. Using Piazza gets the whole course staff at once and is
usually faster than email. Lastly, if none of these work for you you
can send an email asking to set up an appointment.  

# Class Expectations
The class is a shared learning environment, and it is important that
you treat everyone in the class with respect. Some specific things we
will do to try to make the class a welcoming environment: 
- **Accessibility**: I have attempted to make all the course materials
accessible according to web standards. If you need any additional
support, I am always happy to work with you and the DSO to make sure
that the class meets your needs 
- **Inclusivity**: I will be working toward a broad base of examples,
and a welcoming environment for all. Please let me know if you see
opportunities to improve this. 
- **Sharing and Group Projects**: Working together is encouraged, as
long as you in the end implement your own code, and make sure to
document any information you get from other students. You will work on
some of your projects in pairs, and may work in groups on homework in
class to get things started.  
- **Pronouns**: I use she/her, please let me know if you have any specific pronoun preferences

# Grading

Grades will be assigned approximately as follows:
- 10%: exercises
- 50%: labs 1–5
- 10%: lab X
- 10%: Effort, participation and altruism
- 20%: final exam

This maps to the 4.0 scale roughly as follows. You will get at least the grade below for the percentage shown: 
- 90%: at least 3.5 
- 85%: at least 3.0 
- 80%: at least 2.5 
- 75%: at least 2.0 
- 70%: at least 1.5 
- 60%: at least 0.7
